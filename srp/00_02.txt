*sighs*

00000000
In the evening、 I let out a deep sigh alone on a bench in the corner of the\ncourtyard.

00000000
I wonder if the reason why I still feel a little uncomfortable、 even after\nwiping away the dirt in the bathroom by myself、 is because I'm still lingering\non the shock from earlier.

00000000
"My head is still spinning、 and I can't focus properly."

00000000
The embarrassment of ejaculating in front of all those girls still lingers in my\nheart、 making me feel uneasy even now.

00000000
If I could have escaped in the end、 I should have run away before it became\nirreversible.

00000000
"It's no use regretting it now、 but at that time、 I never even considered the\nidea of running away."

00000000
Since then、 during the afternoon classes、 I've been holed up in the bathroom and\nended up skipping class.

00000000
It was one of the few male restrooms established for coeducation、 and as\nexpected、 no girls ever entered. In a way、 it was the most peaceful place.

00000000
However、 I couldn't stay there forever、 and I ended up coming all the way to the\ncourtyard.

00000000
"From now on、 I have to go back to the dormitory、 have a meal in a corner of the\ncafeteria、 and lock myself in my room... I'll have to endure those harsh stares\nagain."

00000000
"And that's why I feel so gloomy、 spending idle time in this usually unpopular\nplace."

00002000
Takumi
Why did things end up like this...

00000000
It was none other than myself who was enticed by the words "special scholarship\nquota" and made the decision about my future path.

00000000
However、 I never expected that the special scholarship quota would only be for\none person、 and that person would be me、  the only male.

00002000
Takumi
Why was it me in the first place...?

00000000
Even now、 I wasn't at a level where I couldn't keep up with the classes、 but I\nwas far from being a model student. In fact、 it would be quicker to count from\nthe bottom.

00000000
There were no other applicants besides me from the beginning... I considered\nthat possibility、 but there were definitely other male students during the\ninterview.

00000000
It's honestly hard for me to believe that I was the one who remained based on my\ngrades、 assuming they were dropped.

00002000
Takumi
No one will tell me the reason...

00000000
There was a time when I tried to ask the teacher through why I was chosen.

00000000
However、 there was no response other than that it was the chairman's decision、 \nand of course、 there was no time for a meeting with the chairman as they said\nthey couldn't spare time for just one student.

00000000
Will this heavy atmosphere continue until graduation...?

00000000
As I pondered、 feeling disheartened、 and let out another deep sigh...

0200BC000100012C666D5F433034615F30335F305F305F305F30312F2D3238302F302E36382F302E3638

00003000
Koharu
Ah、 there you are...
C04a00020001

00002000
Takumi
Huh...? Ah、 Fukunaga-san!?

00000000
I was startled and lifted my hips as a voice called out to me from behind the\nbench.

0200BC000100012C666D5F433034615F30335F305F305F305F30342F2D3238302F302E36382F302E3638

00003000
Koharu
Ah、 sorry、 did I startle you...?
C04a00020002

00002000
Takumi
Ah...no、 it's not...like that...

0200BC000100012C666D5F433034615F30335F305F305F305F30312F2D3238302F302E36382F302E3638

00003000
Koharu
Um... if it's okay... can I sit next to you?
C04a00020003

00002000
Takumi
Uh、 ah、 um、 yeah、 sure、 go ahead...

00003000
Koharu
Thank you. Well then... I'll just intrude for a little while.
C04a00020004

0200BC000100012C666D5F433034615F30335F305F305F305F30312F2D3136302F302E38352F302E3835

00000000
She sat down next to me、 and a completely different tension began to rise.

00000000
After seeing such a sight、 I wondered what I should say... As I hesitated、 \nFukunaga-san spoke up from her side.

0200BC000100012C666D5F433034615F30335F305F305F305F30342F2D3136302F302E38352F302E3835

00003000
Koharu
Um... I don't think you need to worry about it...
C04a00020005

00002000
Takumi
Huh...?

0200BC000100012C666D5F433034615F30335F305F305F305F30372F2D3136302F302E38352F302E3835

00003000
Koharu
In other words... about what happened during the day...
C04a00020006

00002000
Takumi
Uh... um...

00000000
Fukunaga-san didn't elaborate further、 but there was no doubt that she was\nreferring to my blunder.

0200BC000100012C666D5F433034615F30335F305F305F305F30342F2D3136302F302E38352F302E3835

00003000
Koharu
I'm really... sorry. I... couldn't do anything for you...
C04a00020007

00002000
Takumi
Eh... Ah、 no、 it's not like that! Fukunaga-san is not at fault at all!

00003000
Koharu
But... even though someone should have stopped it... I...
C04a00020008

00002000
Takumi
Your feelings alone are enough. Besides、 if I had tried to protect you in a\nplace like that、 who knows what Fukunaga- san would have gone through...

0200BC000100012C666D5F433034615F30335F305F305F305F30362F2D3136302F302E38352F302E3835

00003000
Koharu
Even so、 I... I still think it's strange...
C04a00020009

00002000
Takumi
Fukunaga-san...

00000000
Those words alone have brought so much peace to my heart.

00000000
Above all else、 Fukunaga-san did not despise me.

00000000
Even knowing that I secretly became excited by looking at Fukunaga-san's\ncleavage、 she still worries about me.

00000000
In a school where I have no allies、 she alone speaks kind words and comforts me\nwith all her might.

00002000
Takumi
Um... hey. Why are you so kind to me like this...?

0200BC000100012C666D5F433034615F30335F305F305F305F30342F2D3136302F302E38352F302E3835

00003000
Koharu
Eh... Even if you ask me why...
C04a00020010

00000000
Fukunaga-san averted her gaze with a troubled expression when I asked her.

00006000
Takumi
This reaction... Could it be、 Fukunaga-san... about me...

0200BC000100012C666D5F433034615F30335F305F305F305F30352F2D3136302F302E38352F302E3835

00003000
Koharu
�c�c�c�c�c�c
C04a00020011

00000000
Fukunaga-san's expression、 as she stumbled over her words、  seemed to turn\nslightly red、 but maybe it was just my imagination.

00000000
So、 in other words... you like me... and that's why you're taking care of me\nwithout any particular reason...?

00000000
If I think about it that way、 it explains why you went out of your way to find\nme... No、 if it wasn't for that、 it wouldn't make sense.

00006000
Takumi
But... there's no way a girl would suddenly say something like that、 right?

00000000
If that's the case、 then I need to properly convey my intentions...

00000000
If there is a kind girl like her by my side、 maybe my life at this school will\nbecome enjoyable.

00000000
Unable to suppress my overflowing emotions、 I turn towards Fukunaga-san.

00002000
Takumi
Um... hey、 Fukunaga-san.

0200BC000100012C666D5F433034615F30335F305F305F305F30312F2D3136302F302E38352F302E3835

00003000
Koharu
Yeah、 what is it?
C04a00020012

00002000
Takumi
Um... I might have the same feelings as Fukunaga-san...

0200BC000100012C666D5F433034615F30335F305F305F305F30342F2D3136302F302E38352F302E3835

00003000
Koharu
Eh? The same... feelings?
C04a00020013

00002000
Takumi
So... um、 it's just that I've been somewhat curious about Fukunaga-san...

00002000
Takumi
Before I knew it、 I found myself naturally following you with my eyes... Could\nit be that... I might actually... like you?

00003000
Koharu
Eh... U-um...
C04a00020014

00002000
Takumi
I-if、 if it's okay with Fukunaga-san... I... um... with Fukunaga-san...

0200BC000100012C666D5F433034615F30335F305F305F305F30362F2D3136302F302E38352F302E3835

00003000
Koharu
Wait a minute、 Ikenoue-kun. I don't really have that kind of intention...
C04a00020015

00002000
Takumi
Eh...?

0200BC000100012C666D5F433034615F30335F305F305F305F30342F2D3136302F302E38352F302E3835

00003000
Koharu
Arisa-san told me to take care of anyone who's in trouble... I just felt like I\nshould do it somehow...
C04a00020016

00002000
Takumi
Arisa-san... Kisshouji-san...?

0200BC000100012C666D5F433034615F30335F305F305F305F30362F2D3136302F302E38352F302E3835

00003000
Koharu
So、 um... I mean、 my feelings are a little different from yours、 I'm sorry!
C04a00020017

00000000
I realize for the first time that I had completely lost control and entered a\nstate of frenzy、 being rejected without being able to convey my feelings until\nthe end.

00002000
Takumi
Ah... n-no. S-sorry... I feel like I said something weird.

0200BC000100012C666D5F433034615F30335F305F305F305F30342F2D3136302F302E38352F302E3835

00003000
Koharu
No、 um、 I'm glad to see you're doing better than I thought. Well then、 I'll...\ngo now.
C04a00020018

02008C00010000

00002000
Takumi
Ah...

00000000
I could only watch in a daze as Fukunaga-san ran off without being able to chase\nafter her.

00002000
Takumi
Idiot... Why did I... get carried away like that...

00000000
I foolishly expected to have special feelings all by myself、  but ended up being\ncompletely crushed.

00000000
And on top of that、 it was a complete rejection with absolutely no signs of\ninterest...

00002000
Takumi
Can you please be considerate of Kisshouji-san? What's with that... It's all\nbecause of Kisshouji-san that we're in this situation...

00000000
I truly only had sympathy for Fukunaga-san.

00000000
Once I've pressed for an answer、 there's no way it can be overturned.

00000000
The light that I thought had been lit is once again swallowed by darkness、 \nsinking into deep despair.

00002000
Takumi
I've had enough... I wish I never came to this school...

00000000
Maybe I should just quit... I've even thought about that.

00000000
However、 if I were to drop out even after entering through the special\nscholarship program、 I would undoubtedly be labeled as a problem child.

00000000
I can't imagine finding a good transfer destination from now on、 and if that\nhappens、 my future prospects... both for further education and employment、 look\nhopeless.

00000000
This is not just a problem for one person. It will also tarnish the reputation\nof the school that recommended me and even bring shame to my father.

00002000
Takumi
It's no use... Even if I leave this place、 the situation won't change at all...

00000000
I don't know why I feel that way... I have no basis or evidence、 but I am\nconvinced that it will surely turn out that way.

00002000
Takumi
In the end... I guess I just have to endure until graduation...

00000000
I could feel my dizziness intensifying as I arrived at a bitter conclusion.
