0200000001004247303330305F62

00000000
The next morning... I entered the classroom, trying to make\nmyself as small and inconspicuous as possible.

0100200002026566666563742C65666665637420736974656E5F6B6972696B6165

0200000001004247303230305F62

00000000
As soon as I entered, all eyes turned towards me and I\nimmediately heard whispers and gossip.

00002000
Takumi
………………

00000000
I knew it would turn out like this, but that didn't mean I\ncould just take a day off.

00000000
"At times like this, I can't help but resent the fact that\nit's a boarding school."

00000000
Even if I was feeling unwell, I couldn't just be absent\nwithout a medical certificate from the infirmary. It wasn't\nas simple as just notifying them.

00000000
There's nowhere to escape. Considering that the situation\ncould worsen, there's no choice but to attend.

00000000
Is it at least some consolation that my seat is in the\ncorner of the classroom? I shrink down and quietly take my\nseat.

0200BC000100012C666D5F433034615F30335F305F305F305F30342F2D3238302F302E36382F302E3638

00003000
Koharu
Ah...
C04a00030001

00000000
Ah... Even Fukunaga-san, who arrived before me, noticed me\nand gave a small bow, but perhaps feeling awkward, she\nquickly averted her gaze.

02008C00010000

00000000
"That's also, in a way, to be expected. It's the seed I\nsowed, so I can't really say anything."

00000000
Today, without any allies... I reluctantly put the earphones\nthat I had secretly hidden in my pocket and put them on my\nears.

00006000
Takumi
If this is found, it will surely be confiscated\nimmediately...

00000000
Nevertheless, rather than wearing down my nerves by\nwhispering behind my back... That's what I thought, so I\ndiscreetly started playing music while hiding the earphones\nin my hands.

00000000
When I hear my favorite instrumental music playing, it\nclears away a little bit of the unpleasant haze.

00000000
If it were true, I would have wanted to listen with both\nears and at a higher volume, but if I were found out, it\nwould be a lose-lose situation.

00000000
Right now, even if I were to just slump over my desk, I know\nthat they would find some excuse to pick on me.

00000000
While covering my ears with my hands the whole time, I use\nmy other hand to flip through the textbook, trying not to\nmake it look too unnatural, and fix my gaze on it.

00002000
Student A
...Is that so...

00002000
Student B
...If that's the case...not...

00000000
From the other ear, I can still hear something, but it has\nbecome a faint noise that I can't clearly make out anymore.

00000000
Even if they were talking about me, as long as I don't\nunderstand what they're saying, my heart won't be hurt that\nmuch.

00000000
I reaffirmed that and slightly increased the volume of the\nplayer, focusing my attention on the music.

00000000
Shortly after that--

0200E600000000006400FCFE0000FCFE4B004B004B004B000000E803F401666D5F433032615F30335F305F305F305F3038

00003000
Yuriko
…………
C02a00030001

00000000
When Yuriko quietly enters the classroom, the tension in the\nroom suddenly intensifies.

00000000
In the morning, Kisshouji-san is always late. Yuriko-san\nenters the classroom first, and it has become an unspoken\nagreement for her to tighten the relaxed atmosphere.

00003000
Yuriko
Shinjo-san, the bell is about to ring. Hurry up and take\nyour seat.
C02a00030002

00002000
Student C
Y-Yes...

0200E600000000000000FCFE0000FCFE4B004B004B004B00E8030000F401666D5F433032615F30335F305F305F305F3038

00000000
There's still a little time left, but she scolds her\nclassmates as if she were the teacher.

00000000
Naturally, no one would dare to oppose her, and as a result, \nthe classroom naturally becomes quieter with less chatter--

00002000
Student D
Yuriko-san... You seem a bit grumpy today compared to\nusual...

00002000
Student E
It's because of that person causing trouble again, right? It\ndisrupts the order of the class...

00000000
The discreet whispers, however, continue to be heard\nsomewhere, and Yuriko-san doesn't bother to address them.

00002000
Takumi
………………

00000000
It's no use... I really can't bear it anymore.

020000000100626C

03001000

00000000
I hunched over, pressing my head down, and secretly adjusted\nmy earphones before covering my ears again.

00000000
"Homeroom is about to start soon... Anyway, I'll endure\nuntil then."

03008C0000000F2753455F6130385F30323034

0200000002004247303130305F62

0300000000000F2742474D3130

00000000
Soon, the sound of the music box, which has become a regular\nmorning ritual, began to play through the broadcast.

00006000
Takumi
Uhh...

00000000
Immediately after that, a strong dizziness struck my head, \nand for a moment, my consciousness started to fade.

00006000
Takumi
That... Could this be because of stress? I feel dizzy and\nnauseous...

00000000
The music flowing from my left ear restores my blurred\nconsciousness.

00002000
Takumi
Huh...?

00000000
And, as I casually looked around, I noticed a strange\natmosphere.

00000000
Faint murmurs... The whispers completely vanished, and the\npresence of people suddenly became thin.

00000000
Furthermore, as I looked closer, I noticed that the gazes of\nmy classmates around me were all collectively staring\nblankly into the sky.

00002000
Takumi
Huh...? What is this...? What's happening?

00000000
Huh...? As I was bewildered by the unusual atmosphere, \nYuriko suddenly stood up from her seat without saying a\nword.

0200BC000100012C666D5F433032615F30335F305F305F305F30382F2D3236302F302E37352F302E3735

00003000
Yuriko
………………
C02a00030003

00000000
Without saying a word, she slowly walks through the\nclassroom, carefully observing the students' behavior.

00002000
Takumi
Huh...?

00000000
In an instant, I turned my gaze towards the day after\ntomorrow and pretended to be absent-minded.

00000000
Eventually, as Yuriko looked around the classroom, she\ngently placed her hand on her ear and pulled something out.

00006000
Takumi
...Are those...earplugs...?

00000000
The music box-like melody had stopped without anyone\nnoticing, but everyone still remained in a dazed state.

00000000
Without a word, Yuriko takes her phone in hand and starts\nmaking a call somewhere.

00000000
Yuriko completely disregards the supposed rule of no\ncellphone use in the classroom, and of course, there is no\none to reprimand her for that call.

00003000
Yuriko
Yes, it's me. There's no problem, so please continue as is.
C02a00030004

03008C0000000F2753455F6330315F30313031

02008C00010000

00000000
After finishing her report on the phone, she soon hangs up\nand then――

00005000
Arisa
Good morning, everyone.
C01a00030001

00006000
Takumi
Huh...? This voice, Kisshouji-san...?

00000000
The voice that continued to flow through the broadcast was\nnone other than Kisshouji-san's.

00006000
Takumi
Don't come to the classroom... What's going on?

00000000
As I was thinking that, Kisshouji-san's voice resonated even\nmore.

00005000
Arisa
Let us firmly reaffirm our mindset once again this morning.
C01a00030002

00005000
Arisa
You all, the students of Oukyo Academy, are special\nindividuals chosen from among many outstanding girls.
C01a00030003

00005000
Arisa
That exceptional power must be demonstrated flawlessly when\nthe positions of men and women are reversed in the future.
C01a00030004

00005000
Arisa
Recognize that women who can give birth to and nurture new\nlife are the supreme beings.
C01a00030005

00006000
Takumi
...W-What is this...? We've never had a broadcast like this\nbefore, right...?

00000000
It's like some kind of religious enlightenment... I look\naround again at the words with that kind of content.

00000000
The girls around me, Fukunaga-san and Kamiizumi-san\nincluded, still seem to be wandering their gaze\nabsentmindedly, and I can't tell if they're actually\nlistening to the conversation.

00005000
Arisa
Useless and inferior men should be oppressed and trampled\nupon as a matter of course.
C01a00030006

00005000
Arisa
Today as well, keep that in mind and oppress the sacrificial\nlambs in our class as usual.
C01a00030007

00005000
Arisa
However, Fukunaga Koharu... I expect you to take some care\nso that the sacrificial lamb doesn't break or run away.
C01a00030008

00005000
Arisa
Of course, any excessive physical contact is prohibited. Men\nare creatures who easily misunderstand. Keep that in mind.
C01a00030009

00002000
Takumi
.........!

00000000
The words that struck my heart like a jolt, the girls around\nme still remained in a daze, nodding faintly.

00000000
And then, Yuriko, who remained fully conscious all by\nherself, once again takes her phone in hand and starts\nmaking a call.

0200BC000100012C666D5F433032615F30335F305F305F305F30382F2D3236302F302E37352F302E3735

00003000
Yuriko
Yes, there are no issues today. It seems to have fully sunk\nin.
C02a00030005

00000000
Yuriko's voice resounded surprisingly well in the silent\nroom.

00003000
Yuriko
Yes... Yes, I'll be waiting.
C02a00030006

03008C0000000F2753455F6330315F30313031

00000000
Several minutes after ending that call.

0100200002026566666563742C65666665637420626C61636B6F75745F73686F7274

00003000
Arisa
Good work
C01a00030010

00003000
Yuriko
Yes.
C02a00030007

00000000
When Kisshouji-san entered the classroom, she looked around\nsatisfied as if everything was going according to plan.

00003000
Arisa
Looks like there's no problem... And, 3... 2... 1...
C01a00030011

03008C0000000F2753455F6130365F30313031

00000000
As the countdown began, the sound of the chime echoed\nthrough the broadcast, and the expressions of the students\nreturned to normal all at once.

0300000000000F2742474D3033

0200BC000100022C666D5F433031615F30335F305F305F305F30322F2D3235352F302E37352F302E37352C2D

00003000
Arisa
Good morning, everyone.
C01a00030012

00002000
Student F
Ah, Kisshouji-san, good morning!

00002000
Student G
Good morning, you look beautiful and lovely today as well.

00003000
Arisa
Thank you. Since homeroom is starting, I'll see you later.
C01a00030013

00000000
Kisshouji-san, with a nonchalant expression, brightly smiles\nat her classmates and exchanges greetings.

0100200002026566666563742C65666665637420736974656E5F6B6972696B6165

0200000002004247303130305F62

00002000
Takumi
………………

00000000
After that, the teacher entered the classroom at the usual\ntiming without any changes, and homeroom started as usual.

00006000
Takumi
...What was that just now...

00000000
While she behaved as if nothing had happened, I couldn't\nhide my inner turmoil.

00000000
The context of "oppressing the sacrificial lamb of the\nclass"... It's obvious that the subject being referred to is\nme.

00000000
From the moment I first visited this school, I have felt a\noverwhelming sense of alienation.

00000000
Of course, there may have been situations where I felt out\nof place as the only boy among all the girls.

00000000
However, this is not just that... I wonder if there is\nsomething planned behind all of this.

00002000
Takumi
It definitely wasn't normal... That... Something was\nhappening...

00000000
And without a doubt, I am also being dragged into all of\nthis...

00000000
The doubts that have never surfaced before, I alone have\nstarted to feel a simmering emotion that I have never\nexperienced before.
