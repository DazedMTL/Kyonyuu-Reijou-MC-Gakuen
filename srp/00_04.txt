00000000
After returning to my room, I've been investigating the\nmysterious events from this morning.

00000000
What happened today is definitely not something that should\nbe dismissed as a figment of my imagination or a mistake.

00000000
I continue searching on my computer for any similar cases of\nthis unnatural phenomenon.

00002000
Takumi
...Hypnosis...mind control, huh...

00000000
After researching various things, the word I arrived at was\na rather unrealistic one.

00000000
My image of hypnosis is nothing more than something old-\nfashioned, like shaking a 5-yen coin in front of someone's\neyes.

00000000
Sometimes on TV, there are celebrities who claim to be under\nhypnosis, but I couldn't help but feel skeptical and never\nreally believed it.

00002000
Takumi
But...

00000000
The scene I witnessed was truly the embodiment of that\nunreal situation.

00000000
Moreover, it wasn't just me, but it felt as if time had\nstopped for the entire class, and everything became eerily\nquiet.

00000000
As I think back on it again, I feel like there were moments\nin the morning where my memories inexplicably cut off.

00000000
It felt like the clock suddenly started moving forward even\nthough I was absentmindedly staring at it... That kind of\nsensation.

00000000
At that time, I concluded that it was because I was\nabsentminded, but there was definitely a sense of unease.

00000000
Above all--

役に立たない下等な男は虐げられ、踏みにじられて当然の存在です

アリサ
今日も、そのことをしっかりと念頭に置き、いつものようにクラスの生贄を虐げなさい

アリサ
ただし、福永こはる……あなただけは、生贄が壊れたり、逃げたりしないよう、ある程度のケアをするように

アリサ
もちろん、それ以上の極端な接触は禁じます。男はすぐに勘違いする生き物。肝に銘じておくように

00000000
That voice... There's no mistake, it's Kisshouji-san.

00000000
At that time, Kisshouji-san used the words "Today too..."

00000000
So, what this means is that this isn't something special, \nand if things go wrong, it could happen every day... It\nmeans that those kinds of instructions were being\nbroadcasted on TV.

00000000
I had always thought that the persecution towards me was\ncaused by the atmosphere of conforming to Kisshouji-san's\ngroup.

00000000
However, this morning's incident was much more clear...\nThere was a distinct and deliberate order given.

00000000
"In the first place, even though I myself was being\npersecuted, I somehow resigned myself to the idea that it\nwas just how things were... and accepted it."

だけど、昨日は違った……あの時の僕が、普段と決定的に違っていたことは、イヤホンだ

00000000
And what comes to mind is the sound of the music box that\nplays every morning.

00000000
I had never wondered why, at that timing, I always heard the\nsound of a music box instead of the chime until now.

00002000
Takumi
If I didn't hear it because I was listening to music with my\nearphones at that time...

00000000
Oh right... Come to think of it, Yuriko-san was taking out\nher earplugs just before that.

00000000
If that was a means to prevent me from hearing the sound of\nthe music box...?

00000000
In any case, there is no doubt that Kisshouji-san and Kuga-\nsan are deeply involved.

00000000
But even if I directly confront them about it, there's no\nway they would give me a straight answer.

00000000
Perhaps if I inform them of what I have noticed, they might\ncome up with a different approach.

00002000
Takumi
...I have to somehow uncover the truth behind this...

00000000
If the current hellish situation was intentionally\norchestrated... I can't just continue to let it happen.

00000000
And then, the word "specially recommended slot" that was\ngiven to me comes to mind again.

00000000
If the mysterious entity that entered the school is involved\nin this unknown scheme...

00000000
The chairman who supposedly attempted to change the school's\npolicy... I haven't seen this person even once since I\nentered this school. Could they be involved in something?

00000000
If they were actually the mastermind behind this scheme...?

00002000
Takumi
...Am I overthinking...?

00000000
I shake my head vigorously as I return to reality.

00000000
Either way, rather than continuing to live through these\nmuddy days in the current situation, it's definitely better\nto take action.

00000000
There must be something... I will firmly grasp onto this\nsmall thread and not let go...

00002000
Takumi
………………

00000000
Since coming to this school, I have felt a strong emotion\ndwelling within my heart for the first time.
