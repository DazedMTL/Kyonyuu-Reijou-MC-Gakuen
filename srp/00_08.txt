Arisa
It's open.

00003000
Yuriko
Excuse me.
C02a00080001

00003000
Arisa
Oh... Yuriko. Is something the matter?
C01a00080002

00003000
Yuriko
No, I thought you were coming back a little late... so I\ncame to check on you.
C02a00080002

0200BC000100022C666D5F433031615F30335F305F305F305F30312F2D3235352F302E37352F302E37352C2D

00003000
Arisa
Ah... I just remembered that I have some documents that need\nto be organized quickly.
C01a00080003

0200BC000100022C2D2C666D5F433032615F30335F305F305F305F30312F2D3236302F302E37352F302E3735

00003000
Yuriko
I see. If you had told me, I would have taken care of it...
C02a00080003

00003000
Arisa
It's fine. After all, I have to go through them anyway.\nThank you.
C01a00080004

0200BC000100022C2D2C666D5F433032615F30335F305F305F305F30372F2D3236302F302E37352F302E3735

00003000
Yuriko
Well...
C02a00080004

0200BC000100022C666D5F433031615F30335F305F305F305F30382F2D3235352F302E37352F302E37352C2D

00003000
Arisa
...? Yuriko, is something the matter?
C01a00080005

0200BC000100022C2D2C666D5F433032615F30335F305F305F305F30342F2D3236302F302E37352F302E3735

00003000
Yuriko
Ah... No, um... There was nothing... particularly unusual, \nright?
C02a00080005

00003000
Arisa
Oh... That's quite a roundabout way of saying it for you. I\nwonder what you mean by that?
C01a00080006

0200BC000100022C2D2C666D5F433032615F30335F305F305F305F30372F2D3236302F302E37352F302E3735

00003000
Yuriko
No... If it's nothing, then it's fine. It must have been my\nimagination.
C02a00080006

00003000
Arisa
There's no need to overthink. If there's something that\nbothers you even a little, don't hesitate to tell me.
C01a00080007

00003000
Yuriko
...It's not something that bothers me to that extent, but...
C02a00080007

0200BC000100022C2D2C666D5F433032615F30335F305F305F305F30382F2D3236302F302E37352F302E3735

00003000
Yuriko
Yes, you're right. Maybe it's better to be cautious about\nwhat lies ahead.
C02a00080008

0200BC000100022C666D5F433031615F30335F305F305F305F30342F2D3235352F302E37352F302E37352C2D

00003000
Arisa
Be cautious?
C01a00080008

00003000
Yuriko
Yes. I believe that obstacles will definitely arise as we\nproceed with the plan.
C02a00080009

0200BC000100022C666D5F433031615F30335F305F305F305F30382F2D3235352F302E37352F302E37352C2D

00003000
Arisa
Yes... It's hard to be optimistic and think that everything\nwill go smoothly, isn't it?
C01a00080009

00003000
Yuriko
Of course, I will do my best to eliminate any obstacles.\nHowever, the chairman only has one body...
C02a00080010

00003000
Arisa
So... you're saying that I should have a way to protect\nmyself in case of an emergency?
C01a00080010

0200BC000100022C2D2C666D5F433032615F30335F305F305F305F30372F2D3236302F302E37352F302E3735

00003000
Yuriko
It may be presumptuous of me, but...
C02a00080011

0200BC000100022C666D5F433031615F30335F305F305F305F30312F2D3235352F302E37352F302E37352C2D

00003000
Arisa
No, well, most of the time Yuriko is with me, so I'm not\nworried.
C01a00080011

0200BC000100022C2D2C666D5F433032615F30335F305F305F305F30382F2D3236302F302E37352F302E3735

00003000
Yuriko
Yes...
C02a00080012

0200BC000100022C666D5F433031615F30335F305F305F305F30322F2D3235352F302E37352F302E37352C2D

00003000
Arisa
However, you're right. It might be better to always keep our\nimportant trump card close at hand... that might be a good\nidea.
C01a00080012

00003000
Arisa
I understand. From now on, let's carry this with us just in\ncase.
C01a00080013

00003000
Yuriko
Yes, you're right. It might be better for the time being. We\ncould have a safe in the room as well...
C02a00080013

0200BC000100022C666D5F433031615F30335F305F305F305F30312F2D3235352F302E37352F302E37352C2D

00003000
Arisa
Don't worry, I've got it covered. So, that aspect is fine.
C01a00080014

00003000
Yuriko
Then, your bag. Would it be alright if I usually carry it\nfor you?
C02a00080014

0200BC000100022C666D5F433031615F30335F305F305F305F30322F2D3235352F302E37352F302E37352C2D

00003000
Arisa
Yes, leave it to me. Please make sure I can always access it\nif something happens.
C01a00080015

00003000
Yuriko
Understood.
C02a00080015

0200BC000100022C666D5F433031615F30335F305F305F305F30312F2D3235352F302E37352F302E37352C2D

00003000
Arisa
Well... in that case, shall we go soon?
C01a00080016

00003000
Yuriko
Yes.

Takumi
………………

00000000
I quietly crawl out from behind the hiding spot, making sure\nto confirm that the two of them have left the room while\nholding the music box that was taken out from the safe.

00002000
Takumi
Well... I wonder if the time to act will come after this...?

02006F100900

0200E6000000090000000000000000006400640064006400E803E803F40166696C746572303031

00000000
With a smirk on my face, I gaze intently at the music box in\nmy hands that is almost identical to the one Arisa had.

00000000
Yes, this is a dummy with the same design that was prepared\njust in case the secret of the music box is revealed.

00000000
And... although Arisa believes it, the thing in my hands\nright now is the real hypnotic music box.

00000000
When I heard about its existence from Arisa, who was in a\nmind-controlled state after our intimate moment, my next\nmove had already been decided.

00000000
I will make them recognize the dummy as the real one, and\nfrom now on, I will be the one using the decisive trump\ncard.

00000000
I wonder just how effective it is, and how much I can master\nit.

00000000
There are still many things that I won't know until I try, \nbut I absolutely cannot let go of this trump card.

02008C00010000

00002000
Takumi
With this... I can repay everything that has been done to me\nuntil now...

00000000
Considering that I was the target, not even a trace of guilt\narises.

00000000
The ones who directly confronted me, the ones who continued\nto turn a blind eye, and of course, the mastermind who\nmanipulated everything behind the scenes.

00000000
The first door has already been opened. Now, what should I\ndo next...?

00000000
I couldn't contain the smile that welled up inside me as I\nheld Arisa's first time, my dark emotions boiling over.
