Takumi
Alright... I'll do my best today, and...

00000000
I go to school and enter the classroom, but I feel\nresistance in greeting the girls around me who have been\nlooking at me coldly until now. I quietly try to take my\nseat.

00000000
Then, upon seeing me, Koharu approached with a slightly\nembarrassed expression and greeted me with a small, animal-\nlike gesture, reminiscent of a small creature.

00003000
Koharu
Takumi-kun? Um, well... thank you for the other day... um, \nfor taking the time for someone like me...
C04a02210001

00002000
Takumi
The one who should be thanking is me. Thank you so much for\nthat time.

00000000
I call out to Koharu and, remembering how I made her do\nsomething so embarrassing, I apologize while getting\nflustered.

00003000
Koharu
Thank goodness... But please don't push yourself. I haven't\ndone anything significant enough to deserve a favor in\nreturn... Well then...
C04a02210002

00000000
Koharu, as if fearing even talking to me in public like\nthis, immediately cuts off the conversation and returns to\nher seat.

0200E600000000000000E8FE9CFFE8FE4400440044004400E8030000F401666D5F433034615F30335F305F305F305F3031

00006000
Takumi
I wonder if there's any way I can make Koharu's feelings\nturn towards me... It's lonely to be treated kindly out of\nobligation...

00000000
I considered using the power of the music box to "make her\nfall in love with me," but it's hard to say that I fully\nunderstand its effectiveness.

00000000
This means that there is no guarantee that the brainwashing\nwill continue forever.

00000000
Is there any way for you to set up a favorable situation for\nme?

00000000
When I look at Koharu, she is quiet and has been kind to me\nout of obligation, but she also has her own female friends\nand now she seems to be enjoying a conversation with them.

00006000
Takumi
I got it... If I can put her in a situation like how I was\nbefore getting the music box...

00002000
Female Student A
Haa... The other day, you know, I went shopping for clothes\nwith my boyfriend, and he said he likes outfits that show\nmore shoulder...

00002000
Female Student B
Ahh, that's just insensitive! They don't understand that\noutfits that show the shoulders only look good if you have\nbig breasts!

00002000
Female Student A
That's right! All the clothes that he likes are made with\nwell-fitted cups for the chest! Are you trying to date\nbreasts or something?! That's what I thought.

00002000
Female Student B
There aren't many guys who openly say they prefer girls with\nbig breasts... but there are people whose fashion\npreferences lean towards that... Lucky Koharu...

0200BC000100012C666D5F433034615F30335F305F305F305F30342F2D3238302F302E36382F302E3638

00003000
Koharu
E-eh...!? N-no, I don't really understand that kind of\nthing... I've never had a boyfriend or anything...
C04a02210003

0200BC000100012C666D5F433034615F30335F305F305F305F30312F2D3238302F302E36382F302E3638

00003000
Koharu
You know, having big breasts doesn't necessarily mean you'll\nbe popular...? Men's preferences vary from person to person, \ndon't they?
C04a02210004

0200000001004247303230305F62

00000000
"I'll be the only one to support Koharu."

00000000
I imagined a vision of doing something for Koharu that she\ndid for me, so I put on my earphones and opened the lid of\nthe music box.

00002000
Takumi
Having big breasts means that you will be more liked by men.

00002000
Takumi
In other words, the favorability towards me will increase.

00002000
Takumi
The bigger they are, the higher my favorability towards\nwomen will be, so their value also increases.

00002000
Takumi
That's why everyone becomes uncontrollably envious of\nbreasts that are bigger than their own, bigger than anyone\nelse's.

00000000
I said that and closed the music box, completing the\nimprinting on all the girls in the class.

00002000
Female Student A
Koharu-san, you're so lucky, aren't you? You have such\nsplendid big breasts like a cow.

00002000
Female Student B
If you have breasts like that, stupid guys will come\nflocking to you, right? Well, I'm not into that kind of\nthing though.

00002000
Female Student C
Yeah, yeah, even if they're too big, it's kind of subtle.\nThey make you look fat, so it's not fashionable.

0200BC000100012C666D5F433034615F30335F305F305F305F30342F2D3238302F302E36382F302E3638

00003000
Koharu
Eh... W-wait... everyone...
C04a02210005

00000000
Koharu is bombarded with bitter words mixed with sour grapes\nfrom classmates she had been close with until now.

00000000
Koharu, who was taken aback by the sudden turn of events, \nclearly showed a depressed expression.

00003000
Koharu
Why... why did things turn out like this... sigh...
C04a02210006

00000000
Koharu sat on the edge of a flower bed behind the school\nbuilding at dusk, sighing sadly with a depressed expression.

00000000
Since then, for several days, Koharu has been relentlessly\npersecuted by her classmates because of her breasts, and she\ncould do nothing but spend time alone with nowhere to turn.

00000000
Koharu is not the type to confront her problems aggressively\nlike Arisa or Rio, so she has no choice but to keep her\nworries to herself.

00000000
I thought I might have gone too far, but considering that\nKoharu is also at fault, I decided to approach her and talk\nit out.

00002000
Takumi
You're still not home? You seem a bit down...

0200BC000100012C666D5F433034615F30335F305F305F305F30362F2D3238302F302E36382F302E3638

00003000
Koharu
Ah... W-well, right now... it's better if you don't pay\nattention to me... I might get caught up in the crossfire\nfrom everyone...
C04a02210007

00002000
Takumi
You don't have to worry about that. I want to be on Koharu's\nside. There were times when I was helped too, you know...

0200BC000100012C666D5F433034615F30335F305F305F305F30342F2D3238302F302E36382F302E3638

00003000
Koharu
B-But... with breasts this big... I'm afraid everyone might\nthink it's a bit gross and say so...
C04a02210008

00002000
Takumi
Koharu, your breasts are really wonderful. If they weren't, \nI wouldn't go out of my way to invite you and give you my\nsemen.

0200BC000100012C666D5F433034615F30335F305F305F305F30372F2D3238302F302E36382F302E3638

00003000
Koharu
Yeah... maybe... But what everyone is saying isn't wrong\neither...
C04a02210009

00002000
Takumi
If that's the case, then I'll show you the evidence right\nnow. I'll let you see how much I can ejaculate with Koharu's\nbreasts... I'll make sure to confirm it for you.

0200BC000100012C666D5F433034615F30335F305F305F305F30352F2D3238302F302E36382F302E3638

00003000
Koharu
Y-Yeah... I'm happy... Takumi-kun saying that to me... It\nmade me feel a little better.
C04a02210010

00002000
Takumi
Then, why don't you take off your clothes for a bit?

0200BC000100012C666D5F433034615F30335F305F305F305F30342F2D3238302F302E36382F302E3638

00003000
Koharu
Huh? Here?
