Koharu
U-um... I-I was wondering if you could return the electronic\ndictionary soon... I haven't finished translating it into\nEnglish yet...
C04a02230001

00002000
Female Student A
Huh? What are you talking about? There isn't even a name\nwritten on it, right? So there's no proof that it belongs to\nFukunaga-san. That's right, isn't it?

00002000
Female Student B
Yeah, yeah! I was also watching, and it was definitely\ncertain that it wasn't Fukunaga-san's belongings.

00002000
Female Student C
Wow, I can't believe it! Saying that someone else's things\nare your own! Fukunaga-san is such a dirty person. The\nworst.

00003000
Koharu
Please don't be mean and return it... I'll be in trouble\nwithout it...
C04a02230002

00002000
Female Student A
What, trying to manipulate us with tears? Well, I guess\nyou're used to that kind of thing, right? If you press your\nbig breasts against someone and cry, any normal guy would\ndefinitely fall for it.

00002000
Female Student B
Ah, she definitely did it! It's such a shame that we're\ngirls.

00002000
Female Student C
Don't come near me with those disgusting cow-like breasts\nand beg me for things, okay? Come on, don't get close, go\nover there.

00000000
Koharu continues to be persecuted within the class day after\nday.

00000000
Koharu lent the electronic dictionary after being bowed down\nto, but it was an unavoidable action because she understood\nthat if she didn't lend it, she would be further bullied\nusing that as leverage.

00006000
Takumi
Geez, you never get tired of it... It was the same before I\ngot the music box...

00000000
I realized that even though I was being treated coldly by\neveryone until just a little while ago, now I was calmly\nobserving the scene and feeling at ease.

00000000
The girls around me were like puppets, moving according to\nmy whims. They were nothing more than objects that would\nbecome semen receptacles if I had an excess of sexual desire\nand sought them out.

00000000
The girls, who were recognized as being of a higher class\nand out of reach, quickly began to look down on the\ninsignificant ones after having sex with them multiple\ntimes.

00006000
Takumi
I had heard that girls operate in a group society and that\nthere is a hierarchical vertical society... but seeing it in\nreality, it's beyond despicable...

00000000
Unlike an organization that moves with a specific purpose, \nit is clear to see the criteria of actions based on whether\nthey are emotionally pleasing or displeasing, and whether\nthey are beneficial or detrimental to oneself.

00000000
However, I realized once again that I am trying to make\nKoharu mine by using that, so I couldn't boast about it. I\nchuckled self-deprecatingly.

00006000
Takumi
Well... I guess it's about time to start moving in earnest.

00000000
And so, thinking that way, I resisted the urge to\nimmediately become a hero and show Koharu a cool side of me.\nInstead, I waited for the after-school period when her heart\nwould be completely broken.

Takumi
Phew... Today was quite troublesome, huh...

00000000
I had been complying with various students' requests to\ncollect their semen one by one.

00000000
I was really eager to meet Koharu as soon as possible, but I\ndidn't want to interrupt our precious time together by\nmaking the female students impatient.

00000000
I considered going back midway because I couldn't find\nKoharu, so I returned to the classroom to get my bag.\nHowever, she was sitting alone in the classroom with the\nevening sun shining through.

00000000
Since it seems like she still hasn't noticed me, I observed\nher from the shadows near the door to see what kind of\nemotional state she was in.

00003000
Koharu
Haa... To be treated coldly by everyone because of my\nchest... I wish I had been born with a normal size...

00003000
Koharu
I wonder if there's any way to reconcile somehow...
C04a02230005

00000000
Koharu, unlike Rio, doesn't seem to have the mindset of\nlashing out at those around her. Instead, she was venting\nher frustrations by cursing herself rather than the other\ngirls.

00000000
She is completely blaming herself and losing confidence.

00000000
When I saw through Koharu's emotional state like that, I\nbecame convinced that it was about time, so I quietly\napproached her with an innocent face.

00002000
Takumi
What's wrong? You still haven't gone home?

0200BC000100012C666D5F433034615F30335F305F305F305F30312F2D3238302F302E36382F302E3638

00003000
Koharu
Ah... You're going home already... See you tomorrow...
C04a02230006

00002000
Takumi
Can we talk for a moment?

00003000
Koharu
Huh... Um, did I seem that down?
C04a02230007

00002000
Takumi
Compared to behind the school building the other day, this\nmight be even worse.

0200BC000100012C666D5F433034615F30335F305F305F305F30342F2D3238302F302E36382F302E3638

00003000
Koharu
I see... What is it...
C04a02230008

00002000
Takumi
Rely on me more... I may not be reliable, but...

00003000
Koharu

No matter what everyone else thinks, I will always be on\nKoharu's side.

00003000
Koharu
Takumi-kun... Thank you so much... *sniff*... *sob*...
C04a02230010

00000000
Koharu, deeply moved by my selfless sacrifice, was quickly\novercome with tears.

00002000
Takumi
Koharu... I'll give you confidence again.
