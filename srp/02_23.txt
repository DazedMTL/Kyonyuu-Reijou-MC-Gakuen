Koharu
U-um... I-I was wondering if you could return the electronic dictionary soon...\nI haven't finished translating it into English yet...

Female Student A
Huh? What are you talking about? There isn't even a name written on it、 right?\nSo there's no proof that it belongs to Fukunaga-san. That's right、 isn't it?

00002000
Female Student B
Yeah、 yeah! I was also watching、 and it was definitely certain that it wasn't\nFukunaga-san's belongings.

00002000
Female Student C
Wow、 I can't believe it! Saying that someone else's things are your own!\nFukunaga-san is such a dirty person. The worst.

00003000
Koharu
Please don't be mean and return it... I'll be in trouble without it...
C04a02230002

00002000
Female Student A
What、 trying to manipulate us with tears? Well、 I guess you're used to that kind\nof thing、 right? If you press your big breasts against someone and cry、 any\nnormal guy would definitely fall for it.

00002000
Female Student B
Ah、 she definitely did it! It's such a shame that we're girls.

00002000
Female Student C
Don't come near me with those disgusting cow-like breasts and beg me for things、 \nokay? Come on、 don't get close、 go over there.

00000000
Koharu continues to be persecuted within the class day after day.

00000000
Koharu lent the electronic dictionary after being bowed down to、 but it was an\nunavoidable action because she understood that if she didn't lend it、 she would\nbe further bullied using that as leverage.

00006000
Takumi
Geez、 you never get tired of it... It was the same before I got the music box...

00000000
I realized that even though I was being treated coldly by everyone until just a\nlittle while ago、 now I was calmly observing the scene and feeling at ease.

00000000
The girls around me were like puppets, moving according to my whims. They were\nnothing more than objects that would become semen receptacles if I had an excess\nof sexual desire and sought them out.

00000000
The girls, who were recognized as being of a higher class and out of reach, \nquickly began to look down on the insignificant ones after having sex with them\nmultiple times.

00006000
Takumi
I had heard that girls operate in a group society and that there is a\nhierarchical vertical society... but seeing it in reality, it's beyond\ndespicable...

00000000
Unlike an organization that moves with a specific purpose,  it is clear to see\nthe criteria of actions based on whether they are emotionally pleasing or\ndispleasing, and whether they are beneficial or detrimental to oneself.

00000000
However, I realized once again that I am trying to make Koharu mine by using\nthat, so I couldn't boast about it. I chuckled self-deprecatingly.

00006000
Takumi
Well... I guess it's about time to start moving in earnest.

00000000
And so, thinking that way, I resisted the urge to immediately become a hero and\nshow Koharu a cool side of me. Instead, I waited for the after-school period\nwhen her heart would be completely broken.

Takumi
Phew... Today was quite troublesome, huh...

00000000
I had been complying with various students' requests to collect their semen one\nby one.

00000000
I was really eager to meet Koharu as soon as possible, but I didn't want to\ninterrupt our precious time together by making the female students impatient.

00000000
I considered going back midway because I couldn't find Koharu, so I returned to\nthe classroom to get my bag. However, she was sitting alone in the classroom\nwith the evening sun shining through.

00000000
Since it seems like she still hasn't noticed me, I observed her from the shadows\nnear the door to see what kind of emotional state she was in.

00003000
Koharu
Haa... To be treated coldly by everyone because of my chest... I wish I had been\nborn with a normal size...

00003000
Koharu
I wonder if there's any way to reconcile somehow...
C04a02230005

00000000
Koharu, unlike Rio, doesn't seem to have the mindset of lashing out at those\naround her. Instead, she was venting her frustrations by cursing herself rather\nthan the other girls.

00000000
She is completely blaming herself and losing confidence.

00000000
When I saw through Koharu's emotional state like that, I became convinced that\nit was about time, so I quietly approached her with an innocent face.

00002000
Takumi
What's wrong? You still haven't gone home?

0200BC000100012C666D5F433034615F30335F305F305F305F30312F2D3238302F302E36382F302E3638

00003000
Koharu
Ah... You're going home already... See you tomorrow...
C04a02230006

00002000
Takumi
Can we talk for a moment?

00003000
Koharu
Huh... Um, did I seem that down?
C04a02230007

00002000
Takumi
Compared to behind the school building the other day, this might be even worse.

0200BC000100012C666D5F433034615F30335F305F305F305F30342F2D3238302F302E36382F302E3638

00003000
Koharu
I see... What is it...
C04a02230008

00002000

Rely on me more... I may not be reliable, but...

No matter what everyone else thinks, I will always be on Koharu's side.

00003000
Koharu
Takumi-kun... Thank you so much... *sniff*... *sob*...
C04a02230010

00000000
Koharu, deeply moved by my selfless sacrifice, was quickly overcome with tears.

00002000
Takumi
Koharu... I'll give you confidence again.
