………………

00000000
Early morning in the chairman's office.

00000000
Before going to the classroom after arriving at school, I\nstopped by and rummaged through the filed documents and the\ndatabase on my PC.

00000000
Although it was just a nominal appointment as the chairman, \nI couldn't remain optimistic enough to believe that I could\nleisurely pass the time without doing anything.

00000000
At the very least, Arisa, being Arisa, had some kind of\nulterior motive for serving as the chairman.

00000000
However, from the fact that Arisa is serving as the\nchairman, it's hard to call this a normal educational\ninstitution.

00006000
拓海
やっぱり……あの吉祥寺グループの系列になるよなぁ……

00000000
The Kisshouji Group, which operates businesses in various\nfields both domestically and internationally, is a well-\nknown conglomerate whose name you would inevitably hear\nsomewhere if you live a normal life.

00000000
And from what I lightly investigated, it seems that Arisa\nhas been appointed by the Kisshouji family to serve as the\nchairman of Oukyo Academy.

00006000
拓海
まぁ、吉祥寺家の人間だから、早いうちから帝王学をってことなのかな……

00000000
As a mere ordinary student, I couldn't possibly understand\nthe thoughts of someone from the upper class.

00000000
However, there is one thing that bothers me.

00000000
If they continue to dominate the school so prominently\nthrough mind control, there is a high possibility that some\nsense of discomfort will arise from contact with the\noutside.

00000000
And the most likely source of that concern is none other\nthan the Kisshouji Group itself.

00006000
拓海
アリサにマインドコントロールを施して応対をさせたとして、それでもちゃんとごまかしきれるか……

00000000
Or perhaps, even without Arisa, during summer vacation when\nthe students move out of the dormitory or are out and about.

00000000
I honestly don't know where an unexpected flaw might be\nfound.

00000000
If, hypothetically, we were to catch the attention of the\nKisshouji family... our lives could be in real danger, no\njoke.

00000000
"After all, they have enough influence to appoint a student\nas the chairman of a prestigious school. It wouldn't be\nsurprising no matter what happens."

00006000
拓海
やっぱり、学園全体に範囲を広げたのは少し早まったかな……

00000000
While murmuring timidly, I suddenly notice the music box\nthat I gently placed on the desk.

00000000
And then, strangely, I felt the unease and anxiety fade\naway, and I could feel my heart calming down.

00006000
拓海
そうだ……今の僕にはこれがあるんだから……

00000000
If I think about it, even Arisa, in this chairman's office, \nwas captivated by the music box and had some kind of\nambition.

00000000
The difference in our aspirations may be there, but there is\nno doubt that this music box has something that drives\npeople in such a way.

00000000
I pick up the music box and once again resolve myself.

00000000
"That's right, during this short time, I have had intense\nexperiences."

00000000
"The lesson learned from that result is that if you don't\ntake action, your life will never turn around... that's the\ntruth."

00006000
拓海
こいつを使って、やれるところまでやってみる……最初に決めた通りだ

00000000
Right now, I'm searching through these documents because I\ndon't know what unexpected turn of events might happen if I\njust passively go along.

00000000
If I'm going to expand my reach, I need to secure a more\nsolid foundation.

00000000
It seems that when your surroundings change so dramatically, \nyour mind inevitably starts spinning.

00000000
"For these past few days, I have been desperately\nresearching about this school like never before since I was\nborn."

00006000
拓海
いずれ、アリサにもしっかり話を聞いておいた方がいいだろうな……

00000000
One thing that has been bothering me is whether the\nKisshouji Group knows about the existence of the music box.

00000000
It seems that there were some hints in Arisa's words and\nactions that suggested a conflict with the Kisshouji family.

00000000
If this is truly an irreplaceable existence... if I can use\nit wisely, perhaps I can maintain this paradise without\ncausing unnecessary friction.

00002000
Takumi
Ah... It's about time.

00000000
While I was lost in thought, before I knew it, it was almost\ntime for school.

00002000
Takumi
Well... Today will be another enjoyable day.

00000000
In order to fully enjoy this school life that has turned\ninto paradise from hell, I slowly stood up from my seat.

0100200002026566666563742C65666665637420626C61636B6F75745F6C6F6E67

0300000000000F2742474D3033

00000000
Leaving the chairman's office, I walked along the path to\nthe classroom, passing by the students who were sparsely\narriving for school.

00000000
Occasionally, I started receiving slight nods of\nacknowledgement, which was a clear change compared to\nbefore.

00000000
Until now, I have been completely indifferent. Or perhaps I\nhave only heard whispers of curiosity and disgust.

0300000000000F2742474D3037

00002000
Student
......

00000000
Now, as I pass by, what I feel is the gaze directed towards\nmy crotch.

00000000
Speaking of which, there was a story about how it's\nimmediately noticeable when a guy's gaze goes to a girl's\nchest. Now that I think about it, when I find myself in that\nposition, I can definitely understand.

00000000
Even if it's not explicit, there are girls who sneak glances\nat me with flushed faces.

00000000
Among them, even young female teachers are so distracted by\nmy crotch that they neglect to pay attention to the\nstudents.

00000000
If I continue to receive such gazes, it's only natural that\nI would start to feel the same way.

00000000
As my lower body swells to the point where it's clearly\nvisible even through my pants, the commotion around me grows\neven stronger.

00002000
Takumi
Hehe... I guess I'll put it on hold for now...

00000000
Since it was me who gave a speech that raised expectations, \nit's only natural that I respond to it. It would be pitiful\nif I didn't.

00002000
Takumi
Hmm, I'm starting to feel like I want to ejaculate...

00000000
In the middle of the hallway, without any context, I unzip\nmy zipper and take out my erection.

00003000
Student A
Ah... um, if it's alright with you, I can... milk you!
C05g03010001

00003000
Student B
I-I'll... do it too!
C05f03010001

00003000
Female Teacher
Hey... Onoue-san and Toge-san too... It's not very polite to\nbehave like that...
C05h03010001

00002000
Takumi
Well, well, being proactive is a good thing. How about it, \nwould you like to join us, teacher?

00003000
Tsukishima
Ah... U-um, I... I didn't mean to attract attention on\npurpose...
C05h03010002

00002000
Takumi
I understand. It's because I want to share it with the\nhardworking teacher who is doing their best.

00003000
Tsukishima
Y-Yes. If that's the case...
C05h03010003

00002000
Takumi
It's a short time until class starts, but let's try to be\nfair. Hehe...

00000000
With my words as a signal, the girls who were nearby all\ngathered around me in a flurry.
