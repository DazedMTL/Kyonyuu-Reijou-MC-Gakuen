Early morning in the chairman's office.

00000000
Before going to the classroom after arriving at school, I stopped by and\nrummaged through the filed documents and the database on my PC.

00000000
Although it was just a nominal appointment as the chairman,  I couldn't remain\noptimistic enough to believe that I could leisurely pass the time without doing\nanything.

00000000
At the very least, Arisa, being Arisa, had some kind of ulterior motive for\nserving as the chairman.

00000000
However, from the fact that Arisa is serving as the chairman, it's hard to call\nthis a normal educational institution.

00006000
Takumi
As I thought... we're going to be affiliated with the Kisshouji Group, huh...

00000000
The Kisshouji Group, which operates businesses in various fields both\ndomestically and internationally, is a well- known conglomerate whose name you\nwould inevitably hear somewhere if you live a normal life.

00000000
And from what I lightly investigated, it seems that Arisa has been appointed by\nthe Kisshouji family to serve as the chairman of Oukyo Academy.

00006000
Takumi
Well, since she's from the Kisshouji family, I guess it makes sense for her to\nbe involved in imperial studies from an early age...

00000000
As a mere ordinary student, I couldn't possibly understand the thoughts of\nsomeone from the upper class.

00000000
However, there is one thing that bothers me.

00000000
If they continue to dominate the school so prominently through mind control, \nthere is a high possibility that some sense of discomfort will arise from\ncontact with the outside.

00000000
And the most likely source of that concern is none other than the Kisshouji\nGroup itself.

00006000
Takumi
Even if we assume that Arisa is being controlled through mind control and made\nto act, can she really deceive everyone completely...

00000000
Or perhaps, even without Arisa, during summer vacation when the students move\nout of the dormitory or are out and about.

00000000
I honestly don't know where an unexpected flaw might be found.

00000000
If, hypothetically, we were to catch the attention of the Kisshouji family...\nour lives could be in real danger, no joke.

00000000
"After all, they have enough influence to appoint a student as the chairman of a\nprestigious school. It wouldn't be surprising no matter what happens."

00006000
Takumi
Maybe expanding it to the entire school was a bit premature...

00000000
While murmuring timidly, I suddenly notice the music box that I gently placed on\nthe desk.

00000000
And then, strangely, I felt the unease and anxiety fade away, and I could feel\nmy heart calming down.

00006000
Takumi
That's right... Because I have this now...

00000000
If I think about it, even Arisa, in this chairman's office,  was captivated by\nthe music box and had some kind of ambition.

00000000
The difference in our aspirations may be there, but there is no doubt that this\nmusic box has something that drives people in such a way.

00000000
I pick up the music box and once again resolve myself.

00000000
"That's right, during this short time, I have had intense experiences."

00000000
"The lesson learned from that result is that if you don't take action, your life\nwill never turn around... that's the truth."

00006000
Takumi
I'll use this and do everything I can... just as I decided from the beginning.

00000000
Right now, I'm searching through these documents because I don't know what\nunexpected turn of events might happen if I just passively go along.

00000000
If I'm going to expand my reach, I need to secure a more solid foundation.

00000000
It seems that when your surroundings change so dramatically,  your mind\ninevitably starts spinning.

00000000
"For these past few days, I have been desperately researching about this school\nlike never before since I was born."

00006000
Takumi
Eventually, it would be best to have a proper conversation with Arisa as well...

00000000
One thing that has been bothering me is whether the Kisshouji Group knows about\nthe existence of the music box.

00000000
It seems that there were some hints in Arisa's words and actions that suggested\na conflict with the Kisshouji family.

00000000
If this is truly an irreplaceable existence... if I can use it wisely, perhaps I\ncan maintain this paradise without causing unnecessary friction.

00002000
Takumi
Ah... It's about time.

00000000
While I was lost in thought, before I knew it, it was almost time for school.

00002000
Takumi
Well... Today will be another enjoyable day.

00000000
In order to fully enjoy this school life that has turned into paradise from\nhell, I slowly stood up from my seat.

00000000
Leaving the chairman's office, I walked along the path to the classroom, passing\nby the students who were sparsely arriving for school.

00000000
Occasionally, I started receiving slight nods of acknowledgement, which was a\nclear change compared to before.

00000000
Until now, I have been completely indifferent. Or perhaps I have only heard\nwhispers of curiosity and disgust.

0300000000000F2742474D3037

00002000
Student
......

00000000
Now, as I pass by, what I feel is the gaze directed towards my crotch.

00000000
Speaking of which, there was a story about how it's immediately noticeable when\na guy's gaze goes to a girl's chest. Now that I think about it, when I find\nmyself in that position, I can definitely understand.

00000000
Even if it's not explicit, there are girls who sneak glances at me with flushed\nfaces.

00000000
Among them, even young female teachers are so distracted by my crotch that they\nneglect to pay attention to the students.

00000000
If I continue to receive such gazes, it's only natural that I would start to\nfeel the same way.

00000000
As my lower body swells to the point where it's clearly visible even through my\npants, the commotion around me grows even stronger.

00002000
Takumi
Hehe... I guess I'll put it on hold for now...

00000000
Since it was me who gave a speech that raised expectations,  it's only natural\nthat I respond to it. It would be pitiful if I didn't.

00002000
Takumi
Hmm, I'm starting to feel like I want to ejaculate...

00000000
In the middle of the hallway, without any context, I unzip my zipper and take\nout my erection.

00003000
Student A
Ah... um, if it's alright with you, I can... milk you!
C05g03010001

00003000
Student B
I-I'll... do it too!
C05f03010001

00003000
Female Teacher
Hey... Onoue-san and Toge-san too... It's not very polite to behave like that...
C05h03010001

00002000
Takumi
Well, well, being proactive is a good thing. How about it,  would you like to\njoin us, teacher?

00003000
Tsukishima
Ah... U-um, I... I didn't mean to attract attention on purpose...
C05h03010002

00002000
Takumi
I understand. It's because I want to share it with the hardworking teacher who\nis doing their best.

00003000
Tsukishima
Y-Yes. If that's the case...
C05h03010003

00002000
Takumi
It's a short time until class starts, but let's try to be fair. Hehe...

00000000
With my words as a signal, the girls who were nearby all gathered around me in a\nflurry.
