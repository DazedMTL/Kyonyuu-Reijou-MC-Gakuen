Yuriko
Here is the report. There were no issues with the budget request、 so once we\nreceive approval、 the process will be complete.

00003000
Arisa
...Yes、 I understand.
C01a04040001

00000000
Today、 as usual、 I sit in the chairman's office and listen to Arisa and Yuriko's\nwork performance.

00000000
"As expected、 by listening to their conversations every day、  I have gradually\nstarted to grasp the flow of their work."

00000000
Well、 as for whether I would interfere with the two of them、  of course not.

00000000
It's fine as long as I have a general understanding of the current flow of the\nschool and nothing suddenly becomes a problem.

00003000
Yuriko
And also、 we have received a report from the person who was sent to the main\nhouse. It's regarding the ongoing issue with the Takao family...
C02a04040002

00000000
Furthermore、 Yuriko began her report on the latest developments regarding the\nKisshouji family...

0200BC000100022C666D5F433031615F30335F305F305F305F30342F2D3235352F302E37352F302E37352C2D

00003000
Arisa
�c�c�c�c�c�c
C01a04040002

00000000
It seems that Arisa's expression is unusually tense、 as if her mind is\nelsewhere.

00000000
It seems like she is listening、 but there is an atmosphere as if she has\nforgotten the instructions I gave.

00003000
Yuriko
That's all for the report.

00003000
Yuriko
Arisa...?
C02a04040004

0200BC000100022C666D5F433031615F30335F305F305F305F30372F2D3235352F302E37352F302E37352C2D

00003000
Arisa
Eh...? Ah、 ah... Yes、 thank you. Good work.
C01a04040004

0200BC000100022C2D2C666D5F433032615F30335F305F305F305F30382F2D3236302F302E37352F302E3735

00003000
Yuriko
Arisa... Are you okay? Your complexion doesn't look good... Maybe you should\ntake a little break...
C02a04040005

0200BC000100022C666D5F433031615F30335F305F305F305F30382F2D3235352F302E37352F302E37352C2D

00003000
Arisa
No... I'm fine. Don't worry about me.
C01a04040005

0200BC000100022C2D2C666D5F433032615F30335F305F305F305F30342F2D3236302F302E37352F302E3735

00003000
Yuriko
I see... If you say so、 then it's fine...
C02a04040006

00000000
Arisa let out a small sigh as Yuriko looked at her with a worried expression.

0200BC000100022C666D5F433031615F30335F305F305F305F30372F2D3235352F302E37352F302E37352C2D

00003000
Arisa
...You really have a keen eye. You're very capable... much more so than someone\nlike me...
C01a04040006

0200BC000100022C2D2C666D5F433032615F30335F305F305F305F30372F2D3236302F302E37352F302E3735

00003000
Yuriko
Eh...? W-What are you saying、 Arisa?
C02a04040007

0200BC000100022C666D5F433031615F30335F305F305F305F30342F2D3235352F302E37352F302E37352C2D

00003000
Arisa
Until now、 I've been relying on others without knowing anything... I might have\ncaused a lot of trouble without even realizing it...
C01a04040007

0200BC000100022C2D2C666D5F433032615F30335F305F305F305F30342F2D3236302F302E37352F302E3735

00003000
Yuriko
Arisa... Please wait. I have never done anything like that...
C02a04040008

0200BC000100022C666D5F433031615F30335F305F305F305F30372F2D3235352F302E37352F302E37352C2D

00003000
Arisa
...I see. I guess I said something boring. I'm sorry、 maybe I am tired like\nYuriko said.
C01a04040008

0200BC000100022C2D2C666D5F433032615F30335F305F305F305F30312F2D3236302F302E37352F302E3735

00003000
Yuriko
Ah... In that case、 you should go to the infirmary...
C02a04040009

0200BC000100022C666D5F433031615F30335F305F305F305F30382F2D3235352F302E37352F302E37352C2D

00003000
Arisa
It's okay. I'll go back to the classroom ahead of you. If anything happens、 \nplease let me know.
C01a04040009

0200BC000100022C2D2C666D5F433032615F30335F305F305F305F30342F2D3236302F302E37352F302E3735

00003000
Yuriko
Y-Yes...
C02a04040010

0200BC000100012C666D5F433032615F30335F305F305F305F30342F2D3236302F302E37352F302E3735

00000000
Arisa、 with an aura that made her seem unapproachable、  casually left the\nprincipal's office.

00002000
Takumi
Arisa probably wants to be alone sometimes too. Shouldn't we leave her alone?

0200BC000100012C666D5F433032615F30335F305F305F305F30332F2D3236302F302E37352F302E3735

00003000
Yuriko
�c�c�c�c�c�c
C02a04040011

00000000
Yuriko、 with a look that seemed to say "What do you understand?"、 was glared at、 \nbut without any retort、 she herself began hurriedly preparing to leave.

0200BC000100012C666D5F433032615F30335F305F305F305F30382F2D3236302F302E37352F302E3735

00003000
Yuriko
Excuse me for leaving ahead of you.
C02a04040012

02008C00010000

00000000
Just to be clear、 I'll also leave the room.

00000000
Did she really go after Arisa? No、 considering Yuriko's personality、 she\nprobably wouldn't go that far.

0300000000000F2742474D3130

00002000
Takumi
Hehe... I wonder if that feeling of unease is getting stronger again.

00000000
It's possible that the rumors about Arisa and Yuriko、 which have been gradually\nspreading throughout the school、 are subtly starting to affect Arisa's\nawareness.

00002000
Takumi
If you didn't sweat the small stuff and carried yourself with more confidence、 \nit would have made it easier for me too.

00000000
In reality、 Arisa was like an empress with the kind of charisma that you would\nonly see in dramas or novels.

00000000
It's not just about being academically excellent and athletically talented.

00000000
They understand the meaning of standing above others、 have the awareness of it、 \nand are filled with confidence as someone who has actually stood in that\nposition.

00000000
"That is an element that can be felt fully、 not only when under mind control、 \nbut even now、 after escaping from it."

00000000
Not only is she highly skilled、 but she is also adept at manipulating people's\nhearts and knows how to handle them well.

00000000
From my objective perspective、 I believe Arisa has experienced numerous events\nthat Yuriko couldn't handle.

00000000
However、 despite having such achievements、 it seems that Arisa feels jealous and\nenvious of Yuriko's excellent qualities that she herself does not possess.

00000000
Is it due to the distortion of imperial studies that says one must be all-\npowerful、 or is it due to her personality?

00000000
In any case、 because of her perfectionism、 the complex that arises is like an\nobvious vulnerability in my eyes.

00006000
Takumi
Well... up until now、 we haven't really been in a situation where we had to\nworry about such things... Is this also just a result of youth?

00000000
Honestly、 if I、 a man of my caliber、 were to be manipulated like this、 it's\npossible that I would have fallen from grace sooner or later.

00000000
No、 if it weren't for the music box、 would she have never come out into the\nopen?

00000000
"Once again、 I can't help but feel a fluttering sensation in my chest at the\nfortunate opportunity of having the music box in my hands."

00000000
"The relationship between the two、 which is on the verge of cracking again... I\ncan't just leave it alone here."

00000000
"In order to widen that crack even further、 I have decided to once again narrow\ndown today's target."

00000000
Well、 which one should I use today...
