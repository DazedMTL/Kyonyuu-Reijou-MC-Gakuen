The incident at the girls' dormitory spread throughout the school in no time.

00000000
"We were supposed to keep it a secret among those who were present at that\nplace、 but you can't stop people from talking."

00000000
"Among the people who were present、 it's impossible to determine who exactly was\nthere、 so naturally the story spread as Arisa's blunder."

00000000
Moreover、 it seems that in times like these、 the story often gets embellished or\nexaggerated when spread、 with some even intentionally spreading it in a more\nexaggerated state.

00000000
"Rumors like Arisa trying to monopolize me and putting pressure on me、 but being\nrejected and crying embarrassingly."

00000000
It may not be completely off the mark、 but rumors that greatly undermine the\nimage Arisa has built up were being whispered here and there.

00000000
And there is no one who firmly denies it.

00000000
Arisa herself couldn't raise her voice、 and even if she did、  it wouldn't be\nlistened to. As a result、 Arisa became less inclined to take any noticeable\nactions.

00000000
On the other hand、 as for Yuriko、 even if she tried to deny it、 she couldn't get\nanyone to listen to her.

00000000
Yuriko、 who has been by Arisa's side for a long time、 is rumored to be holding\nsome kind of leverage over her or saying heartless things out of sympathy.

00000000
In a situation where there was no one who knew the original relationship、 there\nwas no one who could understand Yuriko's feelings、 and convenient\ninterpretations were made each time、 resulting in nothing.

00000000
However、 of course、 for Yuriko、 even if she is compared to Arisa and praised、 it\nbrings her no joy.

00000000
As a result、 it seemed that Yuriko was also at a loss and had become withdrawn.

00000000
"People's rumors are truly irresponsible and endless."

00000000
If I were to firmly and accurately proclaim the truth here、  those extreme\nrumors would likely be corrected.

00000000
However、 of course、 there is no way I would do such a thing、  and even if I were\nto accurately convey the information、  there would be no significant change at\nthe fundamental level.

Takumi
Well... with more impact than I expected...

00000000
This is a chance to make a decisive move. While their relationship is wavering、 \nI will quickly fold it in and establish my dominance.

00000000
Well、 then、 what approach should we take from here on out?

00000000
The conclusion I reached after thinking for a while is--
