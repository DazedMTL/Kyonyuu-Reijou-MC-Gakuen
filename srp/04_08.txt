The incident at the girls' dormitory spread throughout the\nschool in no time.

00000000
"We were supposed to keep it a secret among those who were\npresent at that place, but you can't stop people from\ntalking."

00000000
"Among the people who were present, it's impossible to\ndetermine who exactly was there, so naturally the story\nspread as Arisa's blunder."

00000000
Moreover, it seems that in times like these, the story often\ngets embellished or exaggerated when spread, with some even\nintentionally spreading it in a more exaggerated state.

00000000
"Rumors like Arisa trying to monopolize me and putting\npressure on me, but being rejected and crying\nembarrassingly."

00000000
It may not be completely off the mark, but rumors that\ngreatly undermine the image Arisa has built up were being\nwhispered here and there.

00000000
And there is no one who firmly denies it.

00000000
Arisa herself couldn't raise her voice, and even if she did, \nit wouldn't be listened to. As a result, Arisa became less\ninclined to take any noticeable actions.

00000000
On the other hand, as for Yuriko, even if she tried to deny\nit, she couldn't get anyone to listen to her.

00000000
Yuriko, who has been by Arisa's side for a long time, is\nrumored to be holding some kind of leverage over her or\nsaying heartless things out of sympathy.

00000000
In a situation where there was no one who knew the original\nrelationship, there was no one who could understand Yuriko's\nfeelings, and convenient interpretations were made each\ntime, resulting in nothing.

00000000
However, of course, for Yuriko, even if she is compared to\nArisa and praised, it brings her no joy.

00000000
As a result, it seemed that Yuriko was also at a loss and\nhad become withdrawn.

00000000
"People's rumors are truly irresponsible and endless."

00000000
If I were to firmly and accurately proclaim the truth here, \nthose extreme rumors would likely be corrected.

00000000
However, of course, there is no way I would do such a thing, \nand even if I were to accurately convey the information, \nthere would be no significant change at the fundamental\nlevel.

Takumi
Well... with more impact than I expected...

00000000
This is a chance to make a decisive move. While their\nrelationship is wavering, I will quickly fold it in and\nestablish my dominance.

00000000
Well, then, what approach should we take from here on out?

00000000
The conclusion I reached after thinking for a while is--
