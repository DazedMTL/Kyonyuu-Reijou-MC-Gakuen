*sigh*...

00000000
Finally, the unusually long interaction comes to an end, and\nI let out a deep sigh.

00000000
"As expected, it's not just dry, but a heavy sensation\nenvelops my body."

00000000
However, one could say that it was a somewhat pleasant\nfeeling of fatigue, and my heart was unusually fulfilled.

Arisa
...*sigh*...

00000000
Arisa is sleeping, resting her exhausted body by my side.

00000000
Inside the haughty and unbearably perfectionist person, \nthere were hidden struggles and hardships that they could\nnever reveal to others.

00000000
"However, that doesn't mean my anger and hatred disappear\ncompletely. I can't help but feel sympathy, and in the end, \nI'm no different from them, trapped in the same hole."

00000000
Just like Arisa didn't choose her means, I also didn't\nchoose mineÅ\Å\ I might eventually receive the consequences, \njust like Arisa now.

00002000
Takumi
But until then...

00000000
I have not changed my plan to make Arisa mine.

00000000
However, there is still some room for consideration\nregarding how I treat Arisa...

00000000
If I could heal the loneliness that lingers in Arisa's\nheart, just like how she used to cling to Yuriko until\nrecently...

00000000
I gently stroked Arisa's head, thinking about the Arisa who\nclung to me firmly earlier.

Arisa
Mmm...

00000000
Arisa, who is tired and sleeping, unknowingly presses her\ncheek against me, looking comfortable.

00000000
I became aware of something different being born within me\nas I watched her in that state.

00002000
Takumi
Well... But aside from that, there's still another issue\nremaining, you know...

00000000
Taking in Arisa means, in other words, carrying the conflict\nwith the Kisshouji family.

00002000
Takumi
I wonder if there's a way to make it work...

00000000
I gazed at the music box in front of me, contemplating about\nwhat lies ahead.
