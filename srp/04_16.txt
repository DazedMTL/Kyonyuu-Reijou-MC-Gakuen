*sigh*...

00000000
Finally、 the unusually long interaction comes to an end、 and I let out a deep\nsigh.

00000000
"As expected、 it's not just dry、 but a heavy sensation envelops my body."

00000000
However、 one could say that it was a somewhat pleasant feeling of fatigue、 and\nmy heart was unusually fulfilled.

Arisa
...*sigh*...

00000000
Arisa is sleeping、 resting her exhausted body by my side.

00000000
Inside the haughty and unbearably perfectionist person、  there were hidden\nstruggles and hardships that they could never reveal to others.

00000000
"However、 that doesn't mean my anger and hatred disappear completely. I can't\nhelp but feel sympathy、 and in the end、  I'm no different from them、 trapped in\nthe same hole."

00000000
Just like Arisa didn't choose her means、 I also didn't choose mine�\�\ I might\neventually receive the conseque、ces、  just like Arisa now.

00002000
Takumi
But until then...

00000000
I have not changed my plan to make Arisa mine.

00000000
However、 there is still some room for consideration regarding how I treat\nArisa...

00000000
If I could heal the loneliness that lingers in Arisa's heart、 just like how she\nused to cling to Yuriko until recently...

00000000
I gently stroked Arisa's head、 thinking about the Arisa who clung to me firmly\nearlier.

Arisa
Mmm...

00000000
Arisa、 who is tired and sleeping、 unknowingly presses her cheek against me、 \nlooking comfortable.

00000000
I became aware of something different being born within me as I watched her in\nthat state.

00002000
Takumi
Well... But aside from that、 there's still another issue remaining、 you know...

00000000
Taking in Arisa means、 in other words、 carrying the conflict with the Kisshouji\nfamily.

00002000
Takumi
I wonder if there's a way to make it work...

00000000
I gazed at the music box in front of me、 contemplating about what lies ahead.
