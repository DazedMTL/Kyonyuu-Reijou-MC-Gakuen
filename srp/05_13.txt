Female student
Chairman...! Thank you so much...!

00002000
Takumi
Oh no, there's no need to thank me. It's only natural for a\ngirl your age to feel that way.

00002000
Female student
But... you not only helped me overcome the embarrassment of\nbeing a virgin at my age, but also gave me your precious\nsemen... I don't know what to say...

00002000
Takumi
No need for thanks. If anything happens, feel free to rely\non me again.

00002000
Female student
Yes! Then, if you'll excuse me!

0100200002026566666563742C65666665637420626C61636B6F75745F73686F7274

0200000001004247303530305F62

00000000
The female student, feeling refreshed after enjoying her\nfirst time, tidies up her clothes and sits down on a chair.

00000000
Arisa decided to go through the documents that were handled\nas the chairman's work, not just as my substitute... or\nrather, she actually fulfilled the role of the chairman in\nname and reality.

00002000
Takumi
Hmmm... As usual, huh? Reports on purchasing expendables and\nintroducing new teaching materials... It's not really\ninteresting to look at.

00000000
Arisa may have extreme thoughts as a female supremacist, but\nwhen it comes to connections and money, she is as clean as a\npublicly traded company's stock and has no suspicious\naspects.

00000000
Therefore, there was no need for me to waste my nerves, and\nsince I couldn't find any material to enjoy by threatening\nher, looking at these kinds of documents wasn't enjoyable\neither.

00000000
Towards the last few pages, I found a document that didn't\nhave any numbers written on it, and I was intrigued, so I\ncarefully read through its contents.

00002000
Takumi
Hmmm... What's this... "Report to Kisshouji"... Let's see, \nwhat's inside...

00000000
It seems that this is a report from Arisa to the Kisshouji\nfamily, and it appears that she included it to have me\nconfirm the sending as her acting chairman.

00000000
However, the content is very ordinary. It is a report\nproposing the establishment of a system to actively employ\nexcellent graduates from this school in her family's company\nin the future.

00002000
Takumi
Wow... So Arisa's company, which is expanding overseas, is\ntrying to create a school faction with the students from\nthis academy... Big corporate conglomerates really operate\non a different scale...

00000000
I'm not just interested, but rather amazed by it, and\nsuddenly an idea pops into my head that I associate with\nthat report.

00006000
Takumi
I see... Arisa's family, being well-known enough to\nadvertise extensively in the mass media in Kisshouji, \nprobably also owns a talent agency...

00000000
If that's the case, then I might have the potential to\nobtain a perfect means of enjoying the situation, even\nthough it's a problem that I must deal with immediately.

00006000
Takumi
It's dangerous to just leave Rio in the entertainment\nindustry as it is, considering the risk of information\nleakage regarding the mind control within the school...

0300000000000F2742474D3037

00000000
During the recent first recording, Rio's lively and slightly\nfoul-mouthed character creation, as usual, was very well\nreceived and quickly became popular, leading to a flood of\nnew jobs.

00000000
However, in order to stand on a big stage, Rio continues to\nattend this academy while fulfilling her work duties, \nthoroughly creating the image of a student idol.

00000000
Due to her skyrocketing popularity within the school, her\ndedication to work has intensified even more, and she has\nbeen refraining from collecting semen as much as she used\nto.

00000000
Despite being the ringleader of the bullying, the fact that\nshe is popular all over Japan doesn't sit well with me.

00000000
It doesn't seem fun to completely degrade her and make her\nlose her position and dreams.

00000000
Yes, that constant superiority complex, confident yet\njealous and competitive attitude towards others, and the\nawkwardness when it comes to sex... That gap is so\nendearing.

00000000
The charm of her writhing in pleasure, her usual arrogant\nattitude becoming adorable, even though I'm the only one she\nhas had sexual experience with, is something that other\ngirls don't possess.

00006000
Takumi
I want to continue enjoying sex with Rio like this... And, I\ndon't know why, but it feels foolish to have these kind of\nfeelings...

00000000
I realize that I have come to be genuinely supportive of\nRio's success, despite being occasionally tickled by her\npossessive gestures.

00000000
"Because of that, it feels very lonely to think that Rio\nmight go somewhere far away and out of reach if I leave her\nlike this."

00000000
The anxiety that there are many more wonderful men in the\nentertainment industry than me, combined with the desire to\nmonopolize Rio right away, burned fiercely.

00002000
Takumi
Alright... I've made up my mind on what to do. If that's the\ncase, it's time to take action...!

00000000
With my determination firm, I set out to find Arisa, who is\nthe key person in this issue, with a music box in hand...

0100200002026566666563742C65666665637420626C61636B6F75745F6C6F6E67

00003000
Rio
Well... Look who we have here, a celebrity coming all the\nway to see us.
C03a05130001

00000000
I eagerly open the door as Rio's dissatisfied voice echoes\nfrom outside her dorm room.

03008C0000000F2753455F6130315F30303032

0300000000000F2742474D3034

0200000001004247313130305F64

00002000
Takumi
Come on, come in. I've been waiting for you.

0200BC000100012C666D5F433033615F30325F305F305F305F30332F2D3236332F302E37362F302E3736

00003000
Rio
Ugh... It's only natural to make me wait... My schedule is\npacked right now, you know...
C03a05130002

00000000
I asked her a few days ago to come here at night, but it\nseems that her work has been so busy that it would take some\ntime for that request to be fulfilled.

00000000
It seems that she went out of her way to adjust her schedule\namidst the increasing number of photo shoots and TV work, \nand there was clearly a tired expression on her face.

00002000
Takumi
Well, well, take it easy and relax a bit. I know you're\ntired, after all.

0200BC000100012C666D5F433033615F30325F305F305F305F30342F2D3236332F302E37362F302E3736

00003000
Rio
*sigh*... Yeah, I'm tired... So, your invitation is to have\ntea together?
C03a05130003

00002000
Takumi
I have a somewhat complicated story to tell. I thought that\nif I asked Rio, she might come up with a good idea.

00003000
Rio
Oh... If you give me some semen, I'll entertain you, but can\nwe save everything else for another day? I'm seriously\nsleepy, you know...
C03a05130004

00000000
Rio has completely taken on a cold attitude. I couldn't hide\nmy disappointment at the fact that her previously\nenthusiastic and proactive demeanor has been lost.

00000000
It's clear that the priority of responsible work has\ndiminished the effectiveness of her conditioning.

00000000
It is even more evident that she has stopped making\napproaches such as collecting semen on her own.

00006000
Takumi
Whenever I walk down the hallway, there are plenty of girls\nwho ask me for semen... So, that's what it means, huh?

0200BC000100012C666D5F433033615F30325F305F305F305F30332F2D3236332F302E37362F302E3736

00003000
Rio
Hey there. What are you spacing out for? So, what's the\nmatter? Are you gonna give me some semen for now?
C03a05130005

00000000
Rio, with a somewhat careless attitude, throws words at me, \nas if she can't be bothered.

00002000
Takumi
Alright, let's get straight to the main point. ...For now, \ncould you take a look at this?

0200BC000100012C666D5F433033615F30325F305F305F305F30342F2D3236332F302E37362F302E3736

00003000
Rio
What's this... a business card? Or rather, is your name\nwritten on it? What the hell is this supposed to be?
C03a05130006

00000000
Rio tilts her head with a bewildered expression as she looks\nat the business card I handed her.

00002000
Takumi
Hey, hey... Don't rush. Take a look at the words written on\nthe side. In other words, that's what it means.

0200BC000100012C666D5F433033615F30325F305F305F305F30332F2D3236332F302E37362F302E3736

00003000
Rio
Hm... Huh? An entertainment agency? I've never heard of a\ncompany with this name before.
C03a05130007

00002000
Takumi
Well, yeah. It's because I just made it.

00000000
Rio, whose mind control is starting to wear off, doesn't\nblindly accept everything I say as if she's under a spell.\nInstead, she returns my words with a fiercely suspicious\nexpression.

00000000
However, there is no doubt that this is a real entertainment\nagency, and furthermore, it undoubtedly possesses\nsignificant promotional power and expertise.

00000000
I explained that by stimulating Arisa's original goal of\nimproving women's status and using the entertainment agency\nowned by the group, it would make it easier for her to\nadvance in society.

00000000
Of course, at that time, using the music box, I will make\nsure that everything I say is recognized as true.

00000000
And so, by using the entertainment agency owned by the\nKisshouji Group and immediately dismantling it under her\nname, we reconstructed it with me as the president.

00000000
Of course, I didn't think I could just start off with a big\noperation, so I prepared it on a medium-sized scale.

00003000
Rio
Hey... Don't underestimate me too much. I'll let it slide\nsince I'm tired right now, but if you try anything when I'm\nfeeling better, you won't get away with it.
C03a05130008

00002000
Takumi
It's natural to have doubts. But if you think it's a lie, \nwhy don't you try searching for the agency online?

0200BC000100012C666D5F433033615F30325F305F305F305F30342F2D3236332F302E37362F302E3736

00003000
Rio
I don't need to be told that...
C03a05130009

020000000100626C

0200000001004247313130305F64

0200BC000100012C666D5F433033615F30325F305F305F305F30332F2D3236332F302E37362F302E3736

00003000
Rio
...Eh... No way... Seriously... It actually exists... Ah, \nand there are some famous girls affiliated with it too?
C03a05130010

00003000
Rio
W-Well... It's not like there's no possibility that you\ncreated a fake page... I know all about these deceptive\ntechniques, you know...
C03a05130011

020000000100626C

0200000001004247313130305F64

0200BC000100012C666D5F433033615F30325F305F305F305F30342F2D3236332F302E37362F302E3736

00003000
Rio
Wow... Seriously... Huh!? This too!?
C03a05130012

00000000
Rio was cautious and seemed to extend her search even to the\nblogs of the talents affiliated with the agency, but she was\nsurprised when the information about the change in\nmanagement suddenly came up.

0200BC000100012C666D5F433033615F30325F305F305F305F30312F2D3236332F302E37362F302E3736

00003000
Rio
H-Hey... I've recently started making appearances on TV...\nS-So, do you have any intention of hiring me to boost the\nagency's reputation?
C03a05130013

00002000
Takumi
You change your tune quickly, don't you?

0200BC000100012C666D5F433033615F30325F305F305F305F30332F2D3236332F302E37362F302E3736

00003000
Rio
Ugh... So, what's your plan? The fact that you went out of\nyour way to show me your business card means you're serious\nabout it, right?
C03a05130014

00002000
Takumi
Well, yeah. It's because I see potential in Rio's talent\nthat I wanted to see her skills before scouting her.

0200BC000100012C666D5F433033615F30325F305F305F305F30322F2D3236332F302E37362F302E3736

00003000
Rio
I'll do anything. If you're scared of something like that, \nthen you shouldn't aim for the entertainment industry!
C03a05130015

00000000
Seeing Rio confidently declare with a firm tap on her chest, \nI am convinced that I made the right decision in formulating\nthis plan.

00000000
And so, using the carefully prepared equipment in this room, \nRio and I decided to proceed with the test...
