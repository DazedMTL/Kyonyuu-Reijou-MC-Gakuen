Rio, who calmed down and became composed, quickly returned\nto my room with an embarrassed look on her face.

00000000
Blushing as if to distract from her embarrassment, she\nquickly returned to my room and emphasized, "Please take\ncare of the office matters."

Takumi
I wonder... why did I feel that way... about her...

00000000
In the room where I was alone, I became determined to\nanalyze the emotions I had never felt before.

00000000
I honestly couldn't figure out why I felt the desire to\nmonopolize Rio, who had been the target of my hatred until\nnow, to this extent.

00000000
Did Rio also feel the same kind of emotion towards Koharu, \nwho said that she finds the purity of femininity adorable?

00000000
Or perhaps, is it the feeling woven by the desire to\nmonopolize someone who has gathered the envy of people more\nthan anyone else and become so popular that they appear on\nTV?

00000000
Despite originally starting with the intention of\nmanipulating and having sex with the detestable Rio, I found\nmyself in a complex state of mind.

00002000
Takumi
I wonder if I genuinely find Rio adorable, or if I just want\nto possess her... I wonder which one I desire...

00000000
While pondering such things, the originally late night\ngradually grew brighter and I spent the entire night without\nsleeping.
