00000000
The days continued where my classmates in the classroom, and\neven female teachers outside the hallway, would send me\npassionate gazes.

00000000
"The days continued where, depending on my mood, I would\nrespond to requests if desired, and conversely, if I felt\nlike it, I would casually indulge in releasing my sexual\ndesires."

00000000
There haven't been any major issues, and so far there hasn't\nbeen any intervention from the Kisshouji family, who manages\nthe school.

00000000
"I was spending each day smoothly to the point where\neverything was going too smoothly."

Takumi
*sigh*...

00000000
I take a seat in the chairman's office and let out a sigh of\nrelief.

00000000
"Even though I can spend my days as I please, with the\nincreasing attention, mentally, I've been experiencing quite\ntense days."

00000000
Until I obtained the music box, the boys' restroom... and at\nbest, my own room, were the only places of solace. But now, \nthis chairman's office has become a calming place.

00002000
Takumi
Well...finally, tonight.

00000000
Arisa, Yuriko, Rio, Koharu...

00000000
In order to continue this school life, I must give special\ntreatment to those four.

00000000
That's why I've called them to my room tonight. In order to\ndo something "special" for them.

0300000000000F2742474D3037

00002000
Takumi
It's okay... It will surely go well... Just like it has been\nso far.

00000000
As I calm my heart while looking at the music box, I sink my\nbody deep into the chair and close my eyes.

00000000
I surrender myself to the soon-to-come drowsiness and\ngradually fall into a deep sleep...

00003000
Rio
Geez, calling me out at night... You're still acting all\nhigh and mighty, huh?
C03a06010001

00002000
Takumi
Hey, Rio. I don't really get this whole "acting all high and\nmighty" mode, but you're here earlier than expected. You're\nthe first one.

0200BC000100012C666D5F433033615F30325F305F305F305F30352F2D3236332F302E37362F302E3736

00003000
Rio
W-Well, it's not like... I was just bored, that's all... And\nbeing the first one here, it's no big deal, you know?
C03a06010002

00002000
Takumi
It means exactly what it sounds like. I've called out other\ngirls today, so did something happen?

0200BC000100012C666D5F433033615F30325F305F305F305F30342F2D3236332F302E37362F302E3736

00003000
Rio
It's not like... you can do whatever you want.
C03a06010003

00000000
Her attitude is as usual, but she doesn't have that\nunbearable air about her like before. She seems restless and\nfidgety.

0200BC000100012C666D5F433033615F30325F305F305F305F30372F2D3236332F302E37362F302E3736

00003000
Rio
Hmmm... Was this the kind of room...?
C03a06010004

00002000
Takumi
Are you nervous because it's a guy's room?

0200BC000100012C666D5F433033615F30325F305F305F305F30332F2D3236332F302E37362F302E3736

00003000
Rio
Shut up. Don't say whatever you want.
C03a06010005

00000000
Rio shook her head slightly, behaving suspiciously as if she\nhad hit the mark a little.

00000000
Despite her continued snarky remarks, there is a lack of\nstrength in her voice. In reality, it was obvious that she\nwas nervous.

00003000
Yuriko
Excuse me... Ah...
C02a06010001

00003000
Rio
Oh... it's the Disciplinary Committee President.
C03a06010006

00003000
Yuriko
...Kamiizumi-san
C02a06010002

00002000
Takumi
As expected of Yuriko. You're right on time, 15 minutes\nbefore the scheduled meeting. You're so meticulous.

0200BC000100022C2D2C666D5F433032615F30325F305F305F305F30342F2D3236302F302E37352F302E3735

00003000
Yuriko
So it wasn't just me... Is that what you're saying?
C02a06010003

00000000
Yuriko, who has an exceptional sense of intuition, somehow\nrealizes the intention behind being called and murmurs\nsoftly.

00000000
Unlike Rio's restless appearance, there is a somewhat\nmelancholic expression on her face. Could it be because of\nher current mental state?

00000000
In the midst of a relationship that hasn't improved at all\nwith Arisa, I'm strangely being praised by other students\nand I'm caught in a dilemma.

00003000
Rio
It seems like there's been a lot going on lately, huh?
C03a06010007

0200BC000100022C2D2C666D5F433032615F30325F305F305F305F30382F2D3236302F302E37352F302E3735

00003000
Yuriko
What is it?
C02a06010004

00003000
Rio
"What do you mean... about the rumors and various things..."
C03a06010008

0200BC000100022C2D2C666D5F433032615F30325F305F305F305F30332F2D3236302F302E37352F302E3735

00003000

I'm not quite sure what you want to say, but...
C02a06010005

00003000
Rio
Oh, I see. Well, never mind then.
C03a06010009

0200BC000100022C2D2C666D5F433032615F30325F305F305F305F30382F2D3236302F302E37352F302E3735

00003000
Yuriko
………………
C02a06010006

00000000
Perhaps I thought there would be some conversation happening\nto some extent, but as expected, there is no lively\nconversation between these two and an awkward atmosphere\nfills the air.

00003000
Koharu
Ah... um, excuse me... I'm sorry...
C04a06010001

00000000
In the midst of all that, timidly and hesitantly, Koharu\ncame over.

0200BC000100032C666D5F433032615F30325F305F305F305F30382F2D3236302F302E37352F302E37352C666D5F433033615F30325F305F305F305F30342F2D3236332F302E37362F302E37362C666D5F433034615F30325F305F305F305F30342F2D3238302F302E36382F302E3638

00003000
Koharu
Ah, um... Rio-san... Yuriko-san too... Ah, cou-could it be\nthat I'm late...?
C04a06010002

00002000
Takumi
No, you're not late. It's still before the scheduled time, \nso it's okay.

0200BC000100032C2D2C2D2C666D5F433034615F30325F305F305F305F30312F2D3238302F302E36382F302E3638

00003000
Koharu
Ah... Takumi-kun... Th-thank goodness. Um... everyone was\ncalled, right?
C04a06010003

0200BC000100032C2D2C666D5F433033615F30325F305F305F305F30312F2D3236332F302E37362F302E37362C2D

00003000
Rio
Koharu-chan, do you have any idea why you were called?
C03a06010010

0200BC000100032C2D2C2D2C666D5F433034615F30325F305F305F305F30342F2D3238302F302E36382F302E3638

00003000
Koharu
Huh...? Ah, why...? Well, um, I was just told by Ikenoue-kun\nto come to the room...
C04a06010004

0200BC000100032C2D2C666D5F433033615F30325F305F305F305F30372F2D3236332F302E37362F302E37362C2D

00003000
Rio
But, don't you have a rough idea of what this is about?
C03a06010011

0200BC000100032C2D2C2D2C666D5F433034615F30325F305F305F305F30352F2D3238302F302E36382F302E3638

00003000
Koharu
Um... Ah, well... I'm not sure... That, um... ahaha...
C04a06010005

00000000
Koharu, who was being evasive with her words, had a slightly\nflushed face, indicating that she had come with some\nexpectations.

00000000
While surprised by the presence of a previous guest, it\nseems that she doesn't think her expectations were\ncompletely off.

0200BC000100032C2D2C666D5F433033615F30325F305F305F305F30312F2D3236332F302E37362F302E37362C2D

00003000
Rio
You seem to have a pretty good idea. In that case, it's\nabout time...
C03a06010012

0200BC000100032C666D5F433032615F30325F305F305F305F30352F2D3236302F302E37352F302E37352C2D2C2D

00003000
Yuriko
... *silence*...
C02a06010007

00000000
Rio's words made Yuriko tense up.

00000000
"Indeed, as those words suggest--"

00003000
Arisa
………………
C01a06010001

00000000
Without even knocking, quietly entering the room was none\nother than Arisa.

00000000
A few minutes before the promised time. As the last one...\nAlthough it was late for Arisa, she still managed to keep\nthe time, which is characteristic of her after all.

00003000
Arisa
...You called us all together... I already have a pretty\ngood idea of what you're thinking.
C01a06010002

00002000
Takumi
As expected of Arisa... is what I want to say, but it seems\nlike everyone else has a vague idea as well.

0200E60001000200000000009600F9FE4C004C004C004C00E803E8030000666D5F433033615F30325F305F305F305F3032

00003000
Rio
In times like this, it's all about taking the plunge, right?\nWell, as long as I can get what I want, I'm fine with that.
C03a06010013

00003000
Yuriko
It's not enough to do it alone... It really seems like\nsomething you would think about...
C02a06010009

00002000
Takumi
Haha, everyone is perceptive, aren't they? That's right, \nsince I skipped collecting during the day today, I thought\nI'd give all you talented ones a generous amount of semen.

00000000
And at the same time, I will put them under even deeper mind\ncontrol and make them all mine...

00000000
Without saying anything, I silently observe everyone's\nexpressions.

0200E60001000000000000003EFE01FF4B004B004B004B00E803E8030000666D5F433031615F30325F305F305F305F3033

00003000
Arisa
Hmph, there's no need for you to act all high and mighty.\nIt's your duty, after all. How about we start right away?
C01a06010003

00000000
Arisa, with her usual haughty attitude, but with a faint\ntremor of anticipation in her voice.

0200E60001000100000000006AFFFCFE4B004B004B004B00E803E8030000666D5F433032615F30325F305F305F305F3037

00003000
Yuriko
So, we need four people to make you ejaculate... We need to\ndetermine our roles properly, don't we?
C02a06010010

00000000
Yuriko, while maintaining a calm atmosphere, occasionally\nglances at Arisa with a worried expression.

0200E60001000200000000009600F9FE4C004C004C004C00E803E8030000666D5F433033615F30325F305F305F305F3031

00003000
Rio
With all of us together... can we properly handle your dick?
C03a06010014

00000000
Rio, with a provocative smile on her face, becomes acutely\naware of her crotch.

0200E6000100030000000000C201E8FE4400440044004400E803E8030000666D5F433034615F30325F305F305F305F3035

00003000
Koharu
U-Um... I-I guess if we work hard and extract a lot, it'll\nbe fine, right...?
C04a06010007

00000000
While casually listening, Koharu's impressive breasts sway\ngently.

00000000
In the face of a harem situation, I slowly undress while\nsoothing my rock-hard meat rod.

00002000
Takumi
Alright, I'll give you my semen, so let's all enjoy it\ntogether.

00000000
As they gazed at my rock-hard erection, the girls all began\nto deepen their arousal in unison.
