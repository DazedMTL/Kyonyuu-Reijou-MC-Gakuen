Takumi
Ngh... Mmm...

00000000
In the chairman's office、 I slowly lifted my heavy eyelids while sitting on the\nchair.

00002000
Takumi
...Ah... Did I fall asleep?

00000000
I diligently attended my daily classes、 and after school today、 without engaging\nwith anyone、 I secluded myself in the chairman's office to come up with various\nstrategies for the future.

00000000
It seems that I fell asleep while groaning about this and that without being\nable to come up with any specific simulations due to the many undecided parts.

00002000
Takumi
The music box... Yeah、 it's here.

00000000
I couldn't help but feel that I was being too defenseless、  but so far、 nothing\nhas happened that would make me lose this.

00000000
I had a vague sense of it、 but it seems that this music box... makes it\ndifficult for the person who hears it to recognize its existence.

00000000
It's not completely invisible... but despite being a fairly noticeable small\nbox、 it seems like no one pays any attention to it.

00002000
Takumi
Including aspects like that、 it might feel like a magical tool...

00000000
Thank goodness I was fortunate enough to have been able to take this for myself.\nWith gratitude in my heart、 I will once again contemplate what lies ahead.

00000000
In the end、 how to reconcile the conflict between Arisa and the Kisshouji\nfamily... that was the troubling part.

00000000
If the Kisshouji family's intervention becomes more serious、  it will be\ndifficult to maintain the current form of school domination.

00000000
"Of course、 returning to being a student and continuing as before... that might\nbe fine、 but honestly、 I doubt if I can even stay in that position to begin\nwith."

00000000
"I am an irregular element that was drawn in due to Arisa becoming the\nchairperson."

00000000
If Arisa's authority is taken away、 it is highly possible that she could be\ntransferred to another school for any reason.

00000000
"Of course、 I have considered the possibility of taking the music box and\nstarting a new life in a new place."

00000000
However、 honestly、 the environment of Oukyo Academy was too attractive.

00000000
The situation of being surrounded by girls、 most of whom come from well-to-do\nfamilies、 except for myself.

00000000
Of course、 there are cases like Rio and Koharu、 but overall、  the level of\nappearance is high、 and the fact that it is a boarding school with limited\ninteraction with the outside world is also significant.

00002000
Takumi
If possible、 I'd like to repel them successfully... but the opponent is...

00000000
The dilemma is that even the all-powerful music box、 there is hesitation in\nusing it this time.

00000000
The main branch of the Kisshouji family is aware of this music box、 so they\nmight have come up with countermeasures.

00000000
Until I know whether I can use it as a trump card or not、 if I use it carelessly\nand fail、 I won't have any other means afterwards.

00002000
Takumi
...Then、 it would be a return to the nightmare... No、 it might be even worse.

00000000
I don't know how many times I've gone through this cycle、 so I slump down on my\ndesk again.

00000000
And--

00003000
Arisa
...Excuse me.
C01a07010001

00000000
After a modest knock、 the one who entered the principal's office was none other\nthan Arisa、 as rumored.

00002000
Takumi
Ah... Arisa、 huh.

0200BC000100012C666D5F433031615F30335F305F305F305F30342F2D3235352F302E37352F302E3735

00003000
Arisa
Oh... Are you okay? You don't look well.
C01a07010002

00002000
Takumi
Huh...? Ah、 I just dozed off for a bit... um、 there's no need to worry.

0200BC000100012C666D5F433031615F30335F305F305F305F30312F2D3235352F302E37352F302E3735

00003000
Arisa
Is that so? Well、 if that's the case、 then it's fine...
C01a07010003

00000000
Arisa、 with a slightly worried expression、 showed a faint smile. In that whole\nsequence of atmosphere、 there was not a trace of the sharpness I had felt\nbefore.

00000000
It was the genuine concern and relief in her words that belonged to a truly\nkind-hearted girl.

00002000
Takumi
�c�c�c�c�c�c

00000000
Her completely open and sincere gestures、 free from any hostility、 made my heart\nskip a beat.

00000000
Since then、 I have released the mind control that caused the regression of your\nmental age.

00000000
And so、 I reestablished the mind control that ingrained the belief that\ncollecting semen as usual is the ultimate goal.

00000000
I thought about what would happen after returning to school、  now that the\ncorrection in the cabin was over...

00006000
Takumi
I never thought it would turn out like this...

00000000
Arisa's usual arrogance completely vanished in her attitude towards me、 and\nthere were times when she showed signs of relying on me、 as if seeking comfort.

00000000
"I can't say that my position within the school is still good... No、 it's safe\nto say it's close to the worst."

00000000
However、 Arisa herself completely disregards that and selflessly supports me、 \ndiligently carrying out the duties of a council member without asking for\nanything in return.

00000000
I deliberately opened my mouth in a blunt manner、 trying not to show too much\nagitation towards Arisa、 whose behavior had visibly changed.

00002000
Takumi
So? Did you have something you wanted to talk about?

0200BC000100012C666D5F433031615F30335F305F305F305F30372F2D3235352F302E37352F302E3735

00003000
Arisa
Um、 ah... well...
C01a07010004

00000000
Arisa's expression immediately becomes blank.

00002000
Takumi
Could it be that it's about your home again?

0200BC000100012C666D5F433031615F30335F305F305F305F30342F2D3235352F302E37352F302E3735

00003000
Arisa
...Yes. I received another message from my family...
C01a07010005

00002000
Takumi
What kind of conversation? Well、 it doesn't seem like it's going to be a very\ngood one.

00003000
Arisa
Yes... It seems that some people from my main family will be visiting the school\nsoon... Probably within this week...
C01a07010006

00002000
Takumi
That's...

00000000
Previously、 when I contacted my main family、 I submitted an investigation report\nand waited for further instructions after carefully examining the results.

00000000
However、 without even waiting for that report、 they immediately sent a few\npeople to inspect... It seems that they are taking this matter seriously as\nwell.

0200BC000100012C666D5F433031615F30335F305F305F305F30332F2D3235352F302E37352F302E3735

00003000
Arisa
As expected、 that man is pulling the strings again... How infuriating...
C01a07010007

00002000
Takumi
�c�c�c�c�c�c

00003000
Arisa
I will never forgive that bastard who only uses the prestige of our family\nname...
C01a07010008

00000000
I can't help but be shocked by the foul language and insults that I've never\nheard before.

00000000
Perhaps it was because I had touched upon the darkness of the Kisshouji family、 \nwhich was capable of making even their own relatives spill their secrets、 that I\ncouldn't help but feel a little fear towards Arisa.

0300000000000F2742474D3037

00006000
Takumi
Maybe I still only know the surface of Arisa...

00000000
Sometimes she would show a hysterical side、 but I thought it was just a typical\nlight-hearted trait of girls.

00000000
However、 it seems that she not only harbors complexes in her heart、 but also has\na rather passionate side.

00000000
Until now、 I never tried to understand the bitterness and resentment that Arisa\nheld inside her.

00000000
I now realize that various aspects of her personality are emerging one after\nanother.

00006000
Takumi
That's right... I can't help but be concerned about Arisa...

00000000
Since deciding to give them a thorough payback for being thoroughly used、 I have\ngradually begun to see unknown aspects of Arisa.

00000000
I can't deny it、 even though I want to、 I can't help but feel uneasy about this\nsensation.

00000000
I wonder what exactly is the cause of this emotion...

00000000
Now、 if I don't carefully discern that、 I felt like it might shake my judgment\nfrom now on.
