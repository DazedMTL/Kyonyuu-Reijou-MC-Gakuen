Takumi
Ngh... Mmm...

00000000
In the chairman's office, I slowly lifted my heavy eyelids\nwhile sitting on the chair.

00002000
Takumi
...Ah... Did I fall asleep?

00000000
I diligently attended my daily classes, and after school\ntoday, without engaging with anyone, I secluded myself in\nthe chairman's office to come up with various strategies for\nthe future.

00000000
It seems that I fell asleep while groaning about this and\nthat without being able to come up with any specific\nsimulations due to the many undecided parts.

00002000
Takumi
The music box... Yeah, it's here.

00000000
I couldn't help but feel that I was being too defenseless, \nbut so far, nothing has happened that would make me lose\nthis.

00000000
I had a vague sense of it, but it seems that this music\nbox... makes it difficult for the person who hears it to\nrecognize its existence.

00000000
It's not completely invisible... but despite being a fairly\nnoticeable small box, it seems like no one pays any\nattention to it.

00002000
Takumi
Including aspects like that, it might feel like a magical\ntool...

00000000
Thank goodness I was fortunate enough to have been able to\ntake this for myself. With gratitude in my heart, I will\nonce again contemplate what lies ahead.

00000000
In the end, how to reconcile the conflict between Arisa and\nthe Kisshouji family... that was the troubling part.

00000000
If the Kisshouji family's intervention becomes more serious, \nit will be difficult to maintain the current form of school\ndomination.

00000000
"Of course, returning to being a student and continuing as\nbefore... that might be fine, but honestly, I doubt if I can\neven stay in that position to begin with."

00000000
"I am an irregular element that was drawn in due to Arisa\nbecoming the chairperson."

00000000
If Arisa's authority is taken away, it is highly possible\nthat she could be transferred to another school for any\nreason.

00000000
"Of course, I have considered the possibility of taking the\nmusic box and starting a new life in a new place."

00000000
However, honestly, the environment of Oukyo Academy was too\nattractive.

00000000
The situation of being surrounded by girls, most of whom\ncome from well-to-do families, except for myself.

00000000
Of course, there are cases like Rio and Koharu, but overall, \nthe level of appearance is high, and the fact that it is a\nboarding school with limited interaction with the outside\nworld is also significant.

00002000
Takumi
If possible, I'd like to repel them successfully... but the\nopponent is...

00000000
The dilemma is that even the all-powerful music box, there\nis hesitation in using it this time.

00000000
The main branch of the Kisshouji family is aware of this\nmusic box, so they might have come up with countermeasures.

00000000
Until I know whether I can use it as a trump card or not, if\nI use it carelessly and fail, I won't have any other means\nafterwards.

00002000
Takumi
...Then, it would be a return to the nightmare... No, it\nmight be even worse.

00000000
I don't know how many times I've gone through this cycle, so\nI slump down on my desk again.

00000000
And--

00003000
Arisa
...Excuse me.
C01a07010001

00000000
After a modest knock, the one who entered the principal's\noffice was none other than Arisa, as rumored.

00002000
Takumi
Ah... Arisa, huh.

0200BC000100012C666D5F433031615F30335F305F305F305F30342F2D3235352F302E37352F302E3735

00003000
Arisa
Oh... Are you okay? You don't look well.
C01a07010002

00002000
Takumi
Huh...? Ah, I just dozed off for a bit... um, there's no\nneed to worry.

0200BC000100012C666D5F433031615F30335F305F305F305F30312F2D3235352F302E37352F302E3735

00003000
Arisa
Is that so? Well, if that's the case, then it's fine...
C01a07010003

00000000
Arisa, with a slightly worried expression, showed a faint\nsmile. In that whole sequence of atmosphere, there was not a\ntrace of the sharpness I had felt before.

00000000
It was the genuine concern and relief in her words that\nbelonged to a truly kind-hearted girl.

00002000
Takumi
………………

00000000
Her completely open and sincere gestures, free from any\nhostility, made my heart skip a beat.

00000000
Since then, I have released the mind control that caused the\nregression of your mental age.

00000000
And so, I reestablished the mind control that ingrained the\nbelief that collecting semen as usual is the ultimate goal.

00000000
I thought about what would happen after returning to school, \nnow that the correction in the cabin was over...

00006000
Takumi
I never thought it would turn out like this...

00000000
Arisa's usual arrogance completely vanished in her attitude\ntowards me, and there were times when she showed signs of\nrelying on me, as if seeking comfort.

00000000
"I can't say that my position within the school is still\ngood... No, it's safe to say it's close to the worst."

00000000
However, Arisa herself completely disregards that and\nselflessly supports me, diligently carrying out the duties\nof a council member without asking for anything in return.

00000000
I deliberately opened my mouth in a blunt manner, trying not\nto show too much agitation towards Arisa, whose behavior had\nvisibly changed.

00002000
Takumi
So? Did you have something you wanted to talk about?

0200BC000100012C666D5F433031615F30335F305F305F305F30372F2D3235352F302E37352F302E3735

00003000
Arisa
Um, ah... well...
C01a07010004

00000000
Arisa's expression immediately becomes blank.

00002000
Takumi
Could it be that it's about your home again?

0200BC000100012C666D5F433031615F30335F305F305F305F30342F2D3235352F302E37352F302E3735

00003000
Arisa
...Yes. I received another message from my family...
C01a07010005

00002000
Takumi
What kind of conversation? Well, it doesn't seem like it's\ngoing to be a very good one.

00003000
Arisa
Yes... It seems that some people from my main family will be\nvisiting the school soon... Probably within this week...
C01a07010006

00002000
Takumi
That's...

00000000
Previously, when I contacted my main family, I submitted an\ninvestigation report and waited for further instructions\nafter carefully examining the results.

00000000
However, without even waiting for that report, they\nimmediately sent a few people to inspect... It seems that\nthey are taking this matter seriously as well.

0200BC000100012C666D5F433031615F30335F305F305F305F30332F2D3235352F302E37352F302E3735

00003000
Arisa
As expected, that man is pulling the strings again... How\ninfuriating...
C01a07010007

00002000
Takumi
………………

00003000
Arisa
I will never forgive that bastard who only uses the prestige\nof our family name...
C01a07010008

00000000
I can't help but be shocked by the foul language and insults\nthat I've never heard before.

00000000
Perhaps it was because I had touched upon the darkness of\nthe Kisshouji family, which was capable of making even their\nown relatives spill their secrets, that I couldn't help but\nfeel a little fear towards Arisa.

0300000000000F2742474D3037

00006000
Takumi
Maybe I still only know the surface of Arisa...

00000000
Sometimes she would show a hysterical side, but I thought it\nwas just a typical light-hearted trait of girls.

00000000
However, it seems that she not only harbors complexes in her\nheart, but also has a rather passionate side.

00000000
Until now, I never tried to understand the bitterness and\nresentment that Arisa held inside her.

00000000
I now realize that various aspects of her personality are\nemerging one after another.

00006000
Takumi
That's right... I can't help but be concerned about Arisa...

00000000
Since deciding to give them a thorough payback for being\nthoroughly used, I have gradually begun to see unknown\naspects of Arisa.

00000000
I can't deny it, even though I want to, I can't help but\nfeel uneasy about this sensation.

00000000
I wonder what exactly is the cause of this emotion...

00000000
Now, if I don't carefully discern that, I felt like it might\nshake my judgment from now on.
