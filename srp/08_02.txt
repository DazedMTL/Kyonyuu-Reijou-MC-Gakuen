Takumi
...Do I want Yuriko's devotion...?

00000000
When I said it out loud、 my true feelings surprisingly fell into place.

00000000
Yes、 I have always felt envious of the relationship between Arisa and Yuriko.

00000000
In the past、 Yuriko declared that Arisa's happiness was her one and only wish、 \nand she even seemed to find purpose in it.

00000000
It would probably be difficult to break her unwavering feelings、 and even if I\nwere to accomplish that、 she might not be the same Yuriko anymore.

00002000
Takumi
...I don't even have the desire for revenge anymore...

00000000
I feel like I've already had enough of using the music box for revenge.

00000000
Now、 what I have inside me is a more positive approach.

00002000
Takumi
To gain Yuriko's trust... In the end、 will it lead to resolving the issue with\nArisa...?

00000000
The mind control I've used for revenge、 but it's not just for that purpose\nalone.

00000000
Instead of distorting Yuriko's feelings to attract her、 I will create a natural\nway to blend in.

00000000
Arisa's presence within Yuriko is incredibly significant.

00000000
If they can no longer be separated、 then I will merge them together to resolve\nthe issue.

00002000
Takumi
But... when it comes to Arisa's issue... in essence、 it's about the Kisshouji\nfamily、 right...

00000000
I've been trying not to think about it too much、 but it might still be an\nunavoidable problem after all.

00002000
Takumi
�c�c�c�c�c�c

00000000
Various possibilities and situations swirl around in my head.

00000000
"Even though I have an absolute weapon、 I wonder how effective it will be for\nthe Kisshouji family."

00000000
Seeing Arisa carefully filling in the gaps、 I think the music box is indeed a\ntrump card that she had.

00000000
They probably don't know about its existence... If that's the case、 does that\nmean I have a chance too、 or...?

00002000
Takumi
...There's no point in overthinking it、 huh.

00000000
I've managed to turn my life around after being oppressed all this time.

00000000
However、 I don't think this situation can continue indefinitely.

00000000
If it's said that there will inevitably be a wall standing in our way、 then I'll\ngather my courage and give it a try...

00000000
A completely new feeling that has never crossed my mind before was slowly\nstarting to awaken within me.

00000000
Several weeks later--

0300000000000F2742474D3037

0200000001004247303530305F62

0200BC000100012C666D5F433031615F30335F305F305F305F30382F2D3235352F302E37352F302E3735

00003000
Arisa
Oh、 it was quite a sudden visit、 wasn't it?
C01a08020001

00000000
The chairman's office was enveloped in an indescribable tension.

00002000
Male
Um... I'm really sorry for not giving you advance notice... Well、 um...

0200BC000100012C666D5F433031615F30335F305F305F305F30332F2D3235352F302E37352F302E3735

00003000
Arisa
I believe that the proper procedure for a request from the main branch is to\nfollow the appropriate notification process... That's how it has been done up\nuntil now、 I think.
C01a08020002

00002000
Male
Yes、 you are correct. Therefore、 this is not a formal request、 but rather just a\nsmall conversation...

00000000
In front of the desk、 there was a man who introduced himself as a messenger from\nthe Kisshouji family、 bowing repeatedly with a sense of deep apology.

0200BC000100012C666D5F433031615F30335F305F305F305F30382F2D3235352F302E37352F302E3735

00003000
Arisa
So、 you're saying that my opinion alone is not enough?
C01a08020003

00002000
Male
Ah、 well、 how should I put it... It was instructed from above that we would like\nto hear the conversation with multiple people、 so I couldn't really do anything\nabout it... Yes.

0200BC000100012C666D5F433031615F30335F305F305F305F30332F2D3235352F302E37352F302E3735

00003000
Arisa
So、 you're saying that my opinion alone is not enough?
C01a08020004

00002000
Male
No、 no、 it's not like that. Um、 if we could hear various opinions... there was\nalso an intention to do so...

00000000
Arisa is not only unhappy about the sudden visit、 but also because the main\nbranch ordered the school to have three people present.

00000000
Arisa concluded that since no further reasons were given、 it was believed that\nshe alone was considered inadequate in her abilities.

00000000
It's not easy to find someone who can engage in a complicated conversation\nrelated to the Kisshouji family、  even among the people from the school.

00000000
As we were called upon as additional participants、 Yuriko and I are waiting on\nthe side、 even though it wasn't our intention.

0200BC000100012C666D5F433032615F30335F305F305F305F30342F2D3236302F302E37352F302E3735

00003000
Yuriko
�c�c�c�c�c�c
C02a08020001

00000000
Yuriko seemed to keenly realize that Arisa was not welcoming her.

00000000
However、 since I was called here、 I can't just leave on my own.

00000000
She sits on the sofa、 looking uncomfortable、 trying to make herself as small as\npossible so as not to be a bother.

0200BC000100012C666D5F433031615F30335F305F305F305F30332F2D3235352F302E37352F302E3735

00003000
Arisa
So、 about the discussion. If it's regarding the previous talk about the\ndisturbance of discipline within the school...
C01a08020005

00002000
Male
Ah、 no、 it's not about that matter today. It's just that、 if we could hear about\nthe future prospects of this school...

0200BC000100012C666D5F433031615F30335F305F305F305F30372F2D3235352F302E37352F302E3735

00003000
Arisa
You want to hear...?
C01a08020006

00002000
Male
Yes. Um、 as an experimental attempt、 we have started admitting male students、 \nand there are also other matters such as establishing affiliated schools and\nexpanding student recruitment...

0200BC000100012C666D5F433031615F30335F305F305F305F30382F2D3235352F302E37352F302E3735

00003000
Arisa
That... here and now?
C01a08020007

00002000
Male
Yes. How is the situation at the school currently? Have there been any\ndifferences compared to the previous year due to admitting new students...

0200BC000100012C666D5F433031615F30335F305F305F305F30332F2D3235352F302E37352F302E3735

00003000
Arisa
Well、 there hasn't been anything that has gone wrong. We're doing our best as a\nschool entrusted with the daughters of respectable families...
C01a08020008

00002000
Male
Yes、 of course. I was just seeking the opinion of Arisa- sama... as the\nchairperson... Now、 let's continue with the perspective of the faculty...

00000000
After that、 strangely vague and evasive questions continue.

00000000
Arisa couldn't hide her perplexed expression at not being able to grasp the\nsituation、 but she will respond appropriately as the chairperson she has been\nworking diligently as until now.

00006000
Takumi
Geez... Did I beat around the bush too much before getting to the main point?

00000000
While witnessing that exchange、 I stifled a small yawn.

00000000
Well、 to begin with、 the man in front of us isn't exactly a messenger from the\nKisshouji family.

00000000
He may be someone from the Kisshouji family、 but he is already one of the\nindividuals whose perception has been altered by my mind control.

00000000
As a first step in the takeover、 I have been manipulating the person who came\nfor the regular report to extract information and now I am gradually increasing\nmy allies.

00000000
Slowly but surely、 preparations to take over the Kisshouji family are\nprogressing little by little.

00000000
As part of subtly conveying that situation、 I also planned to confirm Arisa's\nintentions、 but perhaps the preamble was too long.

00002000
Takumi
�c�c�c�c�c�c

00000000
I glanced to the side and noticed that Yuriko seemed restless on the sofa、 \nunable to calm down.

00000000
Yuriko、 who has been handling negotiations with the Kisshouji family、 would\nnaturally want to support Arisa and provide accurate advice in response to her\nquestions.

00000000
However、 Yuriko is genuinely afraid of upsetting Arisa's mood by being too\nintrusive.

00000000
Although her appearance doesn't change much、 I naturally find my gaze drifting\ntowards Yuriko、 who seems to be slightly unsettled and fidgeting with her lower\nbody.

00002000
Takumi
...Is there really no need for us to wait honestly?

00000000
Once you get a little excited、 it becomes hard to stop.

00000000
While soothing my rapidly swelling crotch with a firm grip、  in front of her\nplump butt.

00000000
Ignoring Arisa、 who is still engaged in conversation、 I smoothly approach\nYuriko.
