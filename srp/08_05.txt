Several months later--

Takumi
Hmm... Phew...

00000000
After school, I stretch and head out into the hallway.

00000000
"Already in the hallway, the girls from the classes that\nended early were walking around, but even when they saw me, \nthey gave a slight nod and quickly averted their gaze."

00000000
Still the only guy in a school full of girls.

00000000
However, there are no longer any students who pass by me and\nbeg for my semen with lustful eyes.

00000000
That's right. By now, the conditioning that my position\nwould improve if they could collect my semen has long been\nundone.

00000000
They only recognize me as a student of this school and as\nthe chairman, nothing more.

00000000
"Even if I try to rationalize it, I can't help but think how\nabsurd and unbelievable all of this is."

00000000
Well, in that regard, there are still remnants of the\nmindset control that this is the norm even now.

00000000
"Even so, if I keep repeating that this is how things are\nhere, there should be no need to rely on the power of the\nmusic box."

00000000
After all, it is a fact that I am actually working as the\nhead of the Kisshouji family with that title.

00002000
Takumi
Well, it's better to be calm rather than attracting\nunnecessary attention...

00000000
Continuing the harem situation wasn't necessarily a bad\nthing, but there was something more important to me now.

00002000
Takumi
Yuriko... Wasn't she going to the gynecologist after school\ntoday?

00000000
While checking my schedule book, I think about the girl who\nI am still most concerned about even now.

0100200002026566666563742C656666656374206B6169736F75

00000000
Since then--

0300000000000F2742474D3037

0200000001004247303530305F62

00000000
Arisa and Yuriko are helping me with the duties of the\nchairman under the title of my secretary.

00000000
Initially, I had planned to secretly work towards making\nArisa the head of the family, which was the shared\naspiration of the two of them--

00000000
Amidst all the movement, before I knew it, I had become the\ntop with the strange title of executive.

00000000
"Until now, I had been completely relying on others for\neverything, but now I am trying to learn as much as possible\nand every day is a day of study."

00000000
Until graduating from school, there were mountains of things\nto learn in addition to my regular studies.

00000000
"I mainly work in the chairman's office, knowing that every\ntime I ask a question, work will come to a halt, but I'm\nlearning everything I can."

00000000
When I actually touch on how amazing Arisa and Yuriko have\nbeen, it becomes clear.

00000000
The amount of work that keeps coming in one after another\noften overwhelmed me-- However, this is the management of\nthe prestigious Kisshouji family.

00000000
Of course, the system is well-established and it's clear\nthat there is ample support in place and people are actively\nworking.

00000000
Once I managed to somehow get by, my days became challenging\nbut fulfilling.

00000000
It seemed that Arisa also felt confused at first about\nbecoming a secretary like Yuriko.

00000000
"Now, completely shedding the label of incompetence that I\nhad attached to myself, you are demonstrating your true\npotential to the fullest."

00000000
It seemed that for Arisa, Yuriko's presence was more\ncomfortable in an equal position rather than a hierarchical\none.

00000000
We were originally the same age, childhood friends who have\nbeen together since we were little.

00000000
Yuriko still feels a bit intimidated, but now that we have a\nmore casual relationship, she seems more lively.

00000000
It seems that even though she has shown some improvement in\nher dislike of men, that is still a long-term issue.

00000000
Anyway, even though she scolds me like a drill sergeant, she\nfirmly supports me together with Yuriko.

00000000
And as for Yuriko...

00002000
Takumi
Phew... Well, well...

00000000
After stopping by the restroom and sitting in the chair in\nthe chairman's office, there were already various documents\npiled up on the desk.

00002000
Takumi
So this is today's workload...

00000000
It's something I decided to do myself, but when I look at\nthe various complicated procedural documents again, I can't\nhelp but let out a sigh.

00002000
Takumi
No... I have to do my best. Before the two of them come\nback, even if it's just a little...

03008C0000000F2753455F6230315F30343031

00000000
Just as I was thinking that, I heard a knocking sound on the\ndoor.

00002000
Takumi
Please come in.

00002000
Male
Excuse me.

00002000
Takumi
Ah... Uzuyama-san. Thank you.

00000000
It was Uzuyama-san, who is in charge of handling all\nnegotiations for the Kisshouji family, who entered.

00000000
It is none other than the person who I first used mind\ncontrol on when I intruded into the Kisshouji family, and\nthat control has not been released even now.

00002000
Karasuyama
I have brought the promised report...

00002000
Takumi
Huh...? Um, ah, right. Even though I double-checked that it\nwas today... Ah, um...

00002000
Karasuyama
Haha, I received your response during a busy time. Are you\nfeeling a bit tired, President?

00002000
Takumi
No, I'm fine. Since I'm still young, I have plenty of\nenergy, and my secretary is also working hard for me.

00002000
Karasuyama
Oh, that's right. It's truly envy-inducing to have two\nbeautiful ladies supporting you for the whole day.

00002000
Takumi
Uzuyama-san, you also have a wife, don't you?

00002000
Karasuyama
That's a different matter. This is what it is.

00002000
Takumi
Don't say that. Even now, we're in the midst of a lovey-\ndovey relationship, and everyone around us is saying the\nsame thing, you know?

00002000
Karasuyama
Oh my, how embarrassing. Well, of course, I appreciate the\nsentiment, you know?

00002000
Karasuyama
Well, you know, I'm not that young anymore. Sometimes when\nyou work hard at night, it tends to linger until morning.

00002000
Takumi
Ah, but I can kind of understand... Maybe it's because I'm\nalso full of energy every night, so I end up getting tired.

00002000
Karasuyama
Haha, from now on, you'll be experiencing a series of truly\njoyous events. Please take good care of your health.

00002000
Takumi
Thank you very much. I will keep it in mind.

00000000
In an environment where everyone around me is female, it's\nnot easy to find someone to exchange such light banter with.

00000000
It was certainly fortunate for me to have been able to win\nover Karasuyama-san, who had some doubts about the original\none-man system.

00002000
Takumi
Well then, shall we go over the report documents again...?

00000000
In the midst of the peaceful atmosphere, as I tried to\ncontinue the conversation and fix my chair...

00000000
Along with a strange sense of unease at my feet, a sliding\nsound and a figure emerged from under the chairman's desk.
