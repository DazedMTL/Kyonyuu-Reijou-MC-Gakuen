Several months later--

0300000000000F2742474D3033

0200000001004247303330305F62

Takumi
Hmm... Phew...

00000000
After school、 I stretch and head out into the hallway.

00000000
"Already in the hallway、 the girls from the classes that ended early were\nwalking around、 but even when they saw me、  they gave a slight nod and quickly\naverted their gaze."

00000000
Still the only guy in a school full of girls.

00000000
However、 there are no longer any students who pass by me and beg for my semen\nwith lustful eyes.

00000000
That's right. By now、 the conditioning that my position would improve if they\ncould collect my semen has long been undone.

00000000
They only recognize me as a student of this school and as the chairman、 nothing\nmore.

00000000
"Even if I try to rationalize it、 I can't help but think how absurd and\nunbelievable all of this is."

00000000
Well、 in that regard、 there are still remnants of the mindset control that this\nis the norm even now.

00000000
"Even so、 if I keep repeating that this is how things are here、 there should be\nno need to rely on the power of the music box."

00000000
After all、 it is a fact that I am actually working as the head of the Kisshouji\nfamily with that title.

00002000
Takumi
Well、 it's better to be calm rather than attracting unnecessary attention...

00000000
Continuing the harem situation wasn't necessarily a bad thing、 but there was\nsomething more important to me now.

00002000
Takumi
Yuriko... Wasn't she going to the gynecologist after school today?

00000000
While checking my schedule book、 I think about the girl who I am still most\nconcerned about even now.

0100200002026566666563742C656666656374206B6169736F75

00000000
Since then--

0300000000000F2742474D3037

0200000001004247303530305F62

00000000
Arisa and Yuriko are helping me with the duties of the chairman under the title\nof my secretary.

00000000
Initially、 I had planned to secretly work towards making Arisa the head of the\nfamily、 which was the shared aspiration of the two of them--

00000000
Amidst all the movement、 before I knew it、 I had become the top with the strange\ntitle of executive.

00000000
"Until now、 I had been completely relying on others for everything、 but now I am\ntrying to learn as much as possible and every day is a day of study."

00000000
Until graduating from school、 there were mountains of things to learn in\naddition to my regular studies.

00000000
"I mainly work in the chairman's office、 knowing that every time I ask a\nquestion、 work will come to a halt、 but I'm learning everything I can."

00000000
When I actually touch on how amazing Arisa and Yuriko have been、 it becomes\nclear.

00000000
The amount of work that keeps coming in one after another often overwhelmed me--\nHowever、 this is the management of the prestigious Kisshouji family.

00000000
Of course、 the system is well-established and it's clear that there is ample\nsupport in place and people are actively working.

00000000
Once I managed to somehow get by、 my days became challenging but fulfilling.

00000000
It seemed that Arisa also felt confused at first about becoming a secretary like\nYuriko.

00000000
"Now、 completely shedding the label of incompetence that I had attached to\nmyself、 you are demonstrating your true potential to the fullest."

00000000
It seemed that for Arisa、 Yuriko's presence was more comfortable in an equal\nposition rather than a hierarchical one.

00000000
We were originally the same age、 childhood friends who have been together since\nwe were little.

00000000
Yuriko still feels a bit intimidated、 but now that we have a more casual\nrelationship、 she seems more lively.

00000000
It seems that even though she has shown some improvement in her dislike of men、 \nthat is still a long-term issue.

00000000
Anyway、 even though she scolds me like a drill sergeant、 she firmly supports me\ntogether with Yuriko.

00000000
And as for Yuriko...

00002000
Takumi
Phew... Well、 well...

00000000
After stopping by the restroom and sitting in the chair in the chairman's\noffice、 there were already various documents piled up on the desk.

00002000
Takumi
So this is today's workload...

00000000
It's something I decided to do myself、 but when I look at the various\ncomplicated procedural documents again、 I can't help but let out a sigh.

00002000
Takumi
No... I have to do my best. Before the two of them come back、 even if it's just\na little...

03008C0000000F2753455F6230315F30343031

00000000
Just as I was thinking that、 I heard a knocking sound on the door.

00002000
Takumi
Please come in.

00002000
Male
Excuse me.

00002000
Takumi
Ah... Uzuyama-san. Thank you.

00000000
It was Uzuyama-san、 who is in charge of handling all negotiations for the\nKisshouji family、 who entered.

00000000
It is none other than the person who I first used mind control on when I\nintruded into the Kisshouji family、 and that control has not been released even\nnow.

00002000
Karasuyama
I have brought the promised report...

00002000
Takumi
Huh...? Um、 ah、 right. Even though I double-checked that it was today... Ah、 \num...

00002000
Karasuyama
Haha、 I received your response during a busy time. Are you feeling a bit tired、 \nPresident?

00002000
Takumi
No、 I'm fine. Since I'm still young、 I have plenty of energy、 and my secretary\nis also working hard for me.

00002000
Karasuyama
Oh、 that's right. It's truly envy-inducing to have two beautiful ladies\nsupporting you for the whole day.

00002000
Takumi
Uzuyama-san、 you also have a wife、 don't you?

00002000
Karasuyama
That's a different matter. This is what it is.

00002000
Takumi
Don't say that. Even now、 we're in the midst of a lovey- dovey relationship、 and\neveryone around us is saying the same thing、 you know?

00002000
Karasuyama
Oh my、 how embarrassing. Well、 of course、 I appreciate the sentiment、 you know?

00002000
Karasuyama
Well、 you know、 I'm not that young anymore. Sometimes when you work hard at\nnight、 it tends to linger until morning.

00002000
Takumi
Ah、 but I can kind of understand... Maybe it's because I'm also full of energy\nevery night、 so I end up getting tired.

00002000
Karasuyama
Haha、 from now on、 you'll be experiencing a series of truly joyous events.\nPlease take good care of your health.

00002000
Takumi
Thank you very much. I will keep it in mind.

00000000
In an environment where everyone around me is female、 it's not easy to find\nsomeone to exchange such light banter with.

00000000
It was certainly fortunate for me to have been able to win over Karasuyama-san、 \nwho had some doubts about the original one-man system.

00002000
Takumi
Well then、 shall we go over the report documents again...?

00000000
In the midst of the peaceful atmosphere、 as I tried to continue the conversation\nand fix my chair...

00000000
Along with a strange sense of unease at my feet、 a sliding sound and a figure\nemerged from under the chairman's desk.
