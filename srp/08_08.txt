00000000
I want to make Yuriko mine and mine alone...

00000000
When I examined my own feelings、 I realized that it was a very straightforward\ndesire.

00000000
However、 no matter how much I use mind control、 I know from past experience that\nfirmly rooted thoughts cannot be easily distorted.

00000000
The feelings that Arisa has for Yuriko are certainly not something that can be\neasily broken.

00002000
Takumi
So basically... I just need to use it as a foundation without breaking it、 \nright...

00000000
If I change my way of thinking、 I can see countless approaches.

00002000
Takumi
This is just the perfect opportunity...

00000000
Arisa has now lost her position within the school and is also harboring complex\nfeelings towards Yuriko.

00000000
If I can regain Arisa's power at this timing、 her complex feelings towards\nYuriko will vanish.

00000000
And at the same time、 it will also diminish Yuriko's presence within Arisa.

00000000
Yuriko has no interest in achieving her ambitions without Arisa. So、 how does\nArisa feel about being without Yuriko?

00000000
When a relationship that seemed inseparable is no longer the same... What will\nbecome of the gap that is created?

00002000
Takumi
It seems interesting、 doesn't it...

00000000
I can't help but wryly smile at myself、 who has become able to come up with one\nevil scheme after another.

00000000
"I won't know until I try rolling it in various ways."

00000000
"Even so、 I have the power of the music box."

00002000
Takumi
...If I'm going to do it、 why not try something a little more grandiose?

00000000
If I am going to deepen my intervention with Arisa、 there is one problem that I\nsimply cannot avoid.

00000000
Yes、 it's the delicate issue between the Kisshouji main family and the branch\nfamily.

00000000
Arisa and Yuriko once had a conversation about using this school as a stepping\nstone to eventually make the Kisshouji family their own...

00000000
Takumi was probably thinking about what approach he could take after confirming\nthe effect of the music box.

00000000
The power of the music box has already been proven to the utmost extent.

00000000
Most likely、 even the Kisshouji main family is unaware of this、 what you would\ncall a trump card.

00002000
Takumi
Which one... Shall I move in a more grandiose manner?

00000000
It seems like I'll be busy for a while... With my trump card in hand、 I smirked.

0100200002026566666563742C65666665637420626C61636B6F75745F6C6F6E67

0200000001004247303530305F62

00000000
"After that、 there were no major movements at Oukyo Academy for a while."

00000000
Due to the approaching final exams and the upcoming school events and club\nactivities being postponed、 a regular report meeting is being held.

0200BC000100022C666D5F433031615F30335F305F305F305F30382F2D3235352F302E37352F302E37352C666D5F433032615F30335F305F305F305F30382F2D3236302F302E37352F302E3735

00003000
Arisa
Well then、 could you report to me from the staff meeting's report?
C01a08080001

00003000
Yuriko
Yes. I will report to you about what happened yesterday. This week is also right\nbefore the final exams、 so...
C02a08080001

00000000
Yuriko calmly reads aloud the report she obtained、 speaking in a composed tone.

00000000
Arisa's light-hearted banter never comes back in response、  despite her\nseemingly unchanged atmosphere... It's as if she could say that、 but her tone\nremains completely composed.

00000000
Without looking at each other's faces、 we both lower our gaze to the documents、 \nand one after another、 we read out the words in a business-like manner.

00000000
If you knew about the slightly casual atmosphere just a little while ago、 you\nwould understand that the current heaviness is quite significant.

00000000
As someone who knew about it、 I watched the two of them with a smirk.

00006000
Takumi
Even so、 Arisa is the one who made the most effort to come closer...

00000000
At first、 there were times when Yuriko's hesitation led to the responsibility of\nreporting falling on me.

00000000
Currently、 Yuriko has returned to her unchanged role and while feeling relieved\nby Arisa's softened demeanor、 she still cannot break free from her hesitations.

00003000
Yuriko
...That concludes my report.
C02a08080002

00003000
Arisa
Thank you for your hard work.
C01a08080002

00000000
After Arisa's curt response、 there were no further words、  and Yuriko also tried\nto find something to say、 but ultimately fell silent.

00000000
I can't help but think、 looking at the current situation again、 that Yuriko is\nalso quite awkward when it comes to dealing with people.

00000000
And--

03001000

0200BC000100022C666D5F433031615F30335F305F305F305F30372F2D3235352F302E37352F302E37352C2D

00003000
Arisa
Oh... a phone call? Alright、 I'll answer it.
C01a08080003

03008C0000000F2753455F6330315F30303032

0200BC000100012C666D5F433031615F30335F305F305F305F30382F2D37302F312F31

00000000
Arisa took the receiver herself、 interrupting Yuriko as she reached out for it.

00000000
This was also one of Arisa's walls that I had never seen until just a few months\nago.

0300000000000F2742474D3037

00003000
Arisa
Yes... Uh-huh... No... I wasn't listening、 though.
C01a08080004

0200BC000100012C666D5F433031615F30335F305F305F305F30342F2D37302F312F31

00003000
Arisa
Huh? But、 that's a bit much... Yes、 I understand. Of course、  I get that...
C01a08080005

0200BC000100012C666D5F433031615F30335F305F305F305F30332F2D37302F312F31

00003000
Arisa
...Are you serious about that...? Yes... Uh-huh... Yes.
C01a08080006

0200BC000100012C666D5F433032615F30335F305F305F305F30342F2D3236302F302E37352F302E3735

00003000
Yuriko
�c�c�c�c�c�c
C02a08080003

00000000
Yuriko was watching Arisa's puzzled expression with a rather worried look.

0200BC000100012C666D5F433031615F30335F305F305F305F30342F2D37302F312F31

00003000
Arisa
Understood. I will contact you again at a later time. Yes、  uh-huh、 excuse me.
C01a08080007

03008C0000000F2753455F6330315F30303034

00000000
Arisa slowly nodded on the phone and gently placed the receiver back.

0200BC000100022C666D5F433031615F30335F305F305F305F30342F2D3235352F302E37352F302E37352C666D5F433032615F30335F305F305F305F30342F2D3236302F302E37352F302E3735

00003000
Yuriko
Um... What was the nature of the business?
C02a08080004

00000000
Yuriko immediately asked、 as if she couldn't help but be extremely curious.

0200BC000100022C666D5F433031615F30335F305F305F305F30372F2D3235352F302E37352F302E37352C2D

00003000
Arisa
...It wasn't a very calm conversation、 was it...
C01a08080008

00000000
Arisa sighed softly and gazed into the empty space.

0200BC000100022C666D5F433031615F30335F305F305F305F30382F2D3235352F302E37352F302E37352C2D

00003000
Arisa
To put it bluntly、 it's a scandal. There are suspicions of fraudulent loans\nwithin the Kisshouji Group and allegations of bribery. The higher-ups will\nlikely have to take responsibility for it.
C01a08080009

0200BC000100022C2D2C666D5F433032615F30335F305F305F305F30342F2D3236302F302E37352F302E3735

00003000
Yuriko
Umm...
C02a08080005

0200BC000100022C666D5F433031615F30335F305F305F305F30342F2D3235352F302E37352F302E37352C2D

00003000
Arisa
It hasn't become public yet、 but it might be the talk of the town starting from\ntonight...
C01a08080010

0200BC000100022C2D2C666D5F433032615F30335F305F305F305F30382F2D3236302F302E37352F302E3735

00003000
Yuriko
Is that information reliable?
C02a08080006

0200BC000100022C666D5F433031615F30335F305F305F305F30382F2D3235352F302E37352F302E37352C2D

00003000
Arisa
It's information from a reliable source. If you wait a little、 it will be\nreported and the truth will be known immediately. We've long passed the stage\nwhere it can be covered up.
C01a08080011

0200BC000100022C2D2C666D5F433032615F30335F305F305F305F30342F2D3236302F302E37352F302E3735

00003000
Yuriko
...That's...
C02a08080007

0200BC000100022C666D5F433031615F30335F305F305F305F30372F2D3235352F302E37352F302E37352C2D

00003000
Arisa
It seems that they are taking measures to ensure that it doesn't affect the\nschool. However、 it might still be a noisy period for a while.
C01a08080012

00002000
Takumi
Good grief... It's quite a hectic situation、 isn't it? But that phone call just\nnow... It's not just about that、 right?

0200BC000100022C2D2C666D5F433032615F30335F305F305F305F30382F2D3236302F302E37352F302E3735

00003000
Yuriko
...What do you mean by that?
C02a08080008

0200BC000100022C666D5F433031615F30335F305F305F305F30342F2D3235352F302E37352F302E37352C2D

00003000
Arisa
Well... I don't know what will happen with this series of events from now on...
C01a08080013

0200BC000100022C666D5F433031615F30335F305F305F305F30332F2D3235352F302E37352F302E37352C2D

00003000
Arisa
At the very least、 there will be a considerable number of people held\naccountable for this responsibility issue. Of course、 starting with that man.
C01a08080014

00002000
Takumi
Arisa's father... right?

0200BC000100022C2D2C666D5F433032615F30335F305F305F305F30342F2D3236302F302E37352F302E3735

00003000
Yuriko
...!
C02a08080009

0200BC000100022C666D5F433031615F30335F305F305F305F30382F2D3235352F302E37352F302E37352C2D

00003000
Arisa
If we gather together those involved in that group... but if we do that、 it\nseems like the internal personnel will be in disarray.
C01a08080015

0200BC000100022C666D5F433031615F30335F305F305F305F30372F2D3235352F302E37352F302E37352C2D

00003000
Arisa
Those who are trying to use this as an opportunity to push me forward... They're\nsaying that we should let bygones be bygones and support each other、 right?
C01a08080016

0200BC000100022C2D2C666D5F433032615F30335F305F305F305F30332F2D3236302F302E37352F302E3735

00003000
Yuriko
That's... such a selfish and unreasonable thing to say...!
C02a08080010

0200BC000100022C666D5F433031615F30335F305F305F305F30312F2D3235352F302E37352F302E37352C2D

00003000
Arisa
However、 this might be a big opportunity. Even if it's a sudden situation、 \npositions are positions after all.
C01a08080017

00003000
Arisa
They might be thinking of manipulating me like a puppet、 but I'll make sure to\nshow them that it won't be so easy.
C01a08080018

0200BC000100022C2D2C666D5F433032615F30335F305F305F305F30342F2D3236302F302E37352F302E3735

00003000
Yuriko
...However、 this is a very sudden conversation. We should assess the situation\nmore carefully...
C02a08080011

0200BC000100022C666D5F433031615F30335F305F305F305F30372F2D3235352F302E37352F302E37352C2D

00003000
Arisa
...Do you have any objections to me taking the lead?
C01a08080019

0200BC000100022C2D2C666D5F433032615F30335F305F305F305F30342F2D3236302F302E37352F302E3735

00003000
Yuriko
No、 that's not it! I simply meant that we should carefully assess the situation\nand take a more appropriate course of action...
C02a08080012

0200BC000100022C666D5F433031615F30335F305F305F305F30382F2D3235352F302E37352F302E37352C2D

00003000
Arisa
Of course、 I will quickly confirm it. However、 I don't think there is anyone who\ncan set up such a large-scale thing that would tilt this household as a trap.
C01a08080020

0200BC000100022C2D2C666D5F433032615F30335F305F305F305F30372F2D3236302F302E37352F302E3735

00003000
Yuriko
Well... yes... that might be true... but...
C02a08080013

0200BC000100022C666D5F433031615F30335F305F305F305F30332F2D3235352F302E37352F302E37352C2D

00003000
Arisa
...It seems like there's something about you that you're not pleased with after\nall.
C01a08080021

00000000
Arisa muttered words filled with even more anger at Yuriko's worried expression.

00000000
This is the moment I have been waiting for.

00000000
Arisa is by no means incompetent、 but she hasn't been able to effectively\nsublimate her complex towards Yuriko.

00000000
The frank advice is grating on my ears... It's precisely in this state that a\ndecisive rift will be created.

00002000
Takumi
Well、 well、 both of you...

00000000
I nonchalantly put on my earphones and gently open the music box in front of me.

0300000000000F2742474D3037

00002000
Takumi
It's been a while since we used this together... Well then...

00000000
While observing the two of them waiting for instructions、 I first whisper to\nArisa.

00002000
Takumi
There's nothing to worry about. Arisa is excellent、 that's why she was chosen to\nlead the Kisshouji family. There's nothing strange about it.

00002000
Takumi
However、 Yuriko is afraid that her position as the top of the school will be\nreversed once again.

00002000
Takumi
She is certainly excellent. However、 we don't need subordinates who may be more\ncapable than me in reviving the family.

00002000
Takumi
From now on、 it is the true way for a strong woman to support the Kisshouji\nfamily on her own.

00003000
Arisa
Strength... the way a woman should be...
C01a08080023

00002000
Takumi
The things that Arisa has to do for that... you understand、  right?

00000000
After whispering everything to Arisa、 I now bring my face closer to Yuriko.

00002000
Takumi
For Yuriko、 Arisa's words are absolute、 right? Arisa also understands Yuriko.

00002000
Takumi
That's why I might take a strict attitude towards Yuriko、  but it's all for\nYuriko's own good.

00002000
Takumi
Even if she thinks of it as a cold order、 she will be rewarded someday. For that\nreason、 Yuriko has no choice but to accept it.

00000000
I accomplished the brainwashing and、 while putting away the music box、 I call\nout to the two of them again.

00002000
Takumi
When the sound stops and I clap my hands、 you will regain consciousness. Then、 \nshall we continue with our previous conversation? One、 two、 three!

Arisa
Mmm...
C01a08080024

00003000
Yuriko
...Ah...
C02a08080015

00000000
When I clap my hands、 the two of them snap back to their original expressions.

0300000000000F2742474D3036

So...? What does Yuriko want Arisa to do?

Yuriko
...Well、 it's not like I... I just think we should be cautious of convenient\nstories...

Arisa
You're still saying things like that. In other words、 if I clearly say that I\ndon't want to be in a superior position、  how would you react?
C01a08080025

00003000
Yuriko
N-No! Why would I do something like that?!
C02a08080017

Arisa
Certainly、 it wouldn't be interesting if unexpected obstacles got in the way of\nmy chance to stand at the top of this school.
C01a08080026

00003000
Yuriko
Wait、 what are you talking about? Me、 at the top of the school? What kind of bad\njoke is this?
C02a08080018

0200BC000100022C666D5F433031615F30335F305F305F305F30382F2D3235352F302E37352F302E37352C2D

00003000
Arisa
Oh... Is that the talk of the whole school? I'm just a figurehead、 a decoration.\nThey say I'm useless and can't do anything without you.
C01a08080027

00003000
Yuriko
No way... You believe baseless rumors like that more than my words?
C02a08080019

00003000
Yuriko
Arisa standing at the top of the Kisshouji family is our long-cherished wish、 \nhaven't we been working hard together for that?!
C02a08080020

00003000
Arisa
Enough already. In any case、 in order to lead the Kisshouji family、 it must be\ndone by one person... You are not needed there.
C01a08080028

0200BC000100022C2D2C666D5F433032615F30335F305F305F305F30342F2D3236302F302E37352F302E3735

00003000
Yuriko
Arisa... W-Wait、 please... not... that!
C02a08080021

00003000
Arisa
I have nothing more to say. Don't cling to me anymore.

Yuriko
Arisa!
C02a08080022

00000000
With a one-sided declaration、 Arisa left the room.

00003000
Yuriko
Why... why is this happening...
C02a08080023

00000000
Yuriko、 on her knees、 was unable to chase after Arisa in a daze and could only\nsob and groan.
