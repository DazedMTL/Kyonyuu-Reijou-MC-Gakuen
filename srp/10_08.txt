Koharu decided to quickly come up with a countermeasure when she realized she\nwas being mind-controlled.

00000000
But she couldn't come up with a method and was sulking in the courtyard at dusk.

00002000
Takumi
What should I do...

00000000
The frustration bred irritation、 and as a result of the mounting impatience、 no\nideas came to mind.

00000000
Several days had passed since Koharu's confession、 with each night feeling\nlonger than the last.

00003000
Arisa
What a disgraceful sight you're showing、 even though class is about to start...\nHonestly...
C01a10080001

00002000
Takumi
Arisa、 good morning... You're almost late、 but what are you doing?

0200BC000100012C666D5F433031615F30335F305F305F305F30332F2D3235352F302E37352F302E3735

00003000
Arisa
Isn't boycotting class something that shouldn't be done rather than asking\nquestions?
C01a10080002

00002000
Takumi
...Uh、 yeah、 that's right.

0200BC000100012C666D5F433031615F30335F305F305F305F30342F2D3235352F302E37352F302E3735

00003000
Arisa
Sigh... How about trying to understand your own position better?
C01a10080003

00002000
Takumi
I understand...

00002000
Takumi
But more importantly... I can sense a sharper edge in your words than usual. Is\nthere something bothering you?

0200BC000100012C666D5F433031615F30335F305F305F305F30372F2D3235352F302E37352F302E3735

00003000
Arisa
It's a bit... hectic at home、 I suppose.
C01a10080005

00000000
It seems that Arisa has gotten caught up in a situation where the conflict with\nher family has intensified. However、  I have always prioritized Koharu、 and I\nhave not been involved in that matter at all.

0200BC000100012C666D5F433031615F30335F305F305F305F30342F2D3235352F302E37352F302E3735

00003000
Arisa
Things aren't going very well...
C01a10080006

00002000
Takumi
Oh... It's rare to hear Arisa complain like this.

0200BC000100012C666D5F433031615F30335F305F305F305F30382F2D3235352F302E37352F302E3735

00003000
Arisa
If you're teasing me、 I'll get angry now、 you know.
C01a10080007

00002000
Takumi
That's not what I meant... It's just that、 I'm also troubled、 you know...

00002000
Takumi
Well、 that's the spirit! Arisa、 if you take action、 things will work out\nsomehow、 so do your best.

0200BC000100012C666D5F433031615F30335F305F305F305F30352F2D3235352F302E37352F302E3735

00003000
Arisa
Oh、 um... Thank you for your concern.
C01a10080008

0200BC000100012C666D5F433031615F30335F305F305F305F30312F2D3235352F302E37352F302E3735

00003000
Arisa
So... what exactly is troubling you?
C01a10080009

00002000
Takumi
Ah... well...

0200BC000100012C666D5F433031615F30335F305F305F305F30382F2D3235352F302E37352F302E3735

00003000
Arisa
Please spare me your sympathy and try not to bear everything on your own.
C01a10080010

00002000
Takumi
Yeah、 that might be true... Yeah、 you're right.

00002000
Takumi
Well、 I want you to listen... There's something that I just can't let go of...

00002000
Takumi
I might have to let go of it...

05008200F4010000

00002000
Takumi
What would you do、 Arisa?

0200BC000100012C666D5F433031615F30335F305F305F305F30342F2D3235352F302E37352F302E3735

00003000
Arisa
Haa... It was quite a difficult metaphor to understand、 but it seems like you're\ntroubled by something really trivial.
C01a10080012

00002000
Takumi
Even though it may not seem like it、 I'm really desperate.

0200BC000100012C666D5F433031615F30335F305F305F305F30382F2D3235352F302E37352F302E3735

00003000
Arisa
How disappointing.
C01a10080013

0200BC000100012C666D5F433031615F30335F305F305F305F30312F2D3235352F302E37352F302E3735

00003000
Arisa
If it's something that important to you、 shouldn't you try not to let go of it?
C01a10080014

00000000
What are you saying as if it's obvious? Arisa looks at me with that kind of\nexpression.

0300000000000F2742474D3037

02008C00010000

00002000
Takumi
Ah... I see... You're right.

00002000
Takumi
If I make sure not to let go of it from the beginning、  wouldn't everything be\nresolved?

00002000
Takumi
Why would you say something so simple... I...

00000000
I have received a divine revelation. Arisa has given me such a brilliant\ninspiration that can be expressed as such.

00000000
If that's the case、 there is only one thing to do.
